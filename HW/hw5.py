# ## computational complexity

# # __init__: The way I've defined the LinkedList constructor, initializing one
# will always assign None to the head node. The constructor therefore has constant
# complexity, O(1).

# # length: The counter within this function increments by 1 for every item
# in the LinkedList. Since this requires iterating once over every element,
# this method likely has linear complexity, O(n).

# # addNode: Much like length(), this reqires iterating once over every element in the LinkedList,
# so it likely has linear complexity, O(n).

# # addNodeAfter/addNodeBefore: These two methods do not necessarily iterate over all or even many
# of the nodes in the LinkedList and instead depend on the value of the node index passed to
# them. For a given node index, because time complexity does not necessarily increase with the size of the
# LinkedList, these methods will have constant complexity, O(1). However, if we allow node indices to vary,
# larger LinkedLists will inevitably lead to larger index values passed, and in that
# sense they will have linear complexity, O(n).

# # removeNode: This method is a lot like the above 2 and either has linear complexity, O(n),
# or constant complexity, O(1) depending on how the index value input is considered.

# # removeNodeByValue: Because this method depends on a recursive function, it's likely
# to have exponential complexity, O(2^n).

# # reverse: Reversing requires iterating once over every node in the LinkedList, and
# so has linear complexity, O(n).


# For most of these, the constraint on using other data types effectively requires
# iterating over all the elements, and in the case of removeNodeByValue(), changing
# references as nodes get removed also require the use of a recursive function.
