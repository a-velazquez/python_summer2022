"Jan 20, 2021",Inaugural Address,"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans: This is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge. Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people—the will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now, on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one Nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way—restless, bold, optimistic—and set our sights on the Nation we know we can be and we must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our Nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken, the oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on ""We the People,"" who seek a more perfect Union. This is a great Nation; we are good people. Over the centuries, through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far. But we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities: much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain. Few people in our Nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost; hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise of political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges—to restore the soul and secure the future of America—requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity. Unity. In another January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, and I quote, ""If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it."" My whole soul is in it. Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our Nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause: uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment, and hatred; extremism, lawlessness, violence; disease, joblessness, and hopelessness. With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice, and we can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. And victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our ""better angels"" have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us—enough of us—have come together to carry all of us forward. And we can do that now. History, faith, and reason show the way: the way of unity. We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together. And so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another, hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed. Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at another Inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever—not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I am humbled by the faith you've placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps this Nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans—all Americans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love—defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love? That define us as Americans? I think we know: opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies: lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders—leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our Nation—to defend the truth and defeat the lies. Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering: ""Can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage?"" Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment. Stand in their shoes. Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That is what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree. My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation. One Nation. And I promise you this: As the Bible says, ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" We will get through this, together—together. Look, folks, all my colleagues that I served with in the House and the Senate up here. We all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested, and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. Look, you all know, we have been through so much in this Nation. And, in my first act as President, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans: moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We will honor them by becoming the people and Nation we know we can and should be. So I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. [At this point, a moment of silence was observed.] Amen. Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once, presenting this Nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us? It is time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you: We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion, is the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must; I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will. And when we do, we will write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America: the American story, a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It's called ""American Anthem,"" and there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes like this: ""The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this dayWhat shall be our legacy? What will our children say? . . .Let me know in my heart when my days are throughAmerica, America, I gave my best to you."" Let's add—let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great Nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: ""They gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land."" My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word: I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. And I will give all, all of you, keep everything you—I do, in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities; not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear; of unity, not division; of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment; democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch, but thrived; that America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. So with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America."

"Jan 22, 2021",Remarks on Signing Executive Orders on Economic Relief Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Protecting the Federal Workforce and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hey, Doctor, how are you? National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. Mr. President, how are you? The President. You're going to be doing a lot of talking to me, that's why. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Dr. Fauci, nice to see you. Director Fauci. Nice to see you. The President. Good afternoon. Before I begin with today's announcement, let me take a few moments to thank all the law enforcement folks for all they did, the military personnel, from all across the Federal, State, and local agencies that secured yesterday's Inaugural activities. And a special thanks to the members of the National Guard from around the country. It was an unprecedented situation; hopefully, it will never have to be renewed again. And everyone handled it with the most professionalism and duty and honor that could be expected. The President—as President, as Commander in Chief, I always respect and revere their service and that of their families. But now, to today's announcement: Vice President Harris and I were joined by members of our COVID-19 team—response team—and Dr. Tony Fauci, our chief COVID medical adviser; Xavier Becerra—excuse me—our nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services; Dr. Vivek Murthy, our nominee for Surgeon General; Dr. Rochelle Walensky—she's going to be the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who will be leading our equity work in the COVID response; and Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian, who are managing this whole effort. Yesterday, during my Inaugural Address, I offered a salient prayer and a silent prayer—it was both salient and silent. I thought it was important that people understand what had happened, that we all pay tribute to the—our prayers for those 400,000 Americans who have lost their lives in this pandemic. On Tuesday, Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, we stood at the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial and joined Americans all across the country to remember those 400,000 moms and dads, husbands and wives, children—sons, daughters. And I said at that moment that to heal, we must remember. To heal, we must remember. It's important to do that as a Nation. But we must also act, though, not just remember. Yet, for the past year, we couldn't rely on the Federal Government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination we needed. And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure: 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day. To date, more than 24 million Americans—24 million Americans—have been infected. To put that in context, America makes up 4 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 20 percent of all the COVID-19 deaths, when we have 4 percent of the world's population. The pandemically—the pandemic, excuse me, has disproportionately impacted on Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans, who are about four times as likely to be hospitalized and nearly three times more likely to die from the COVID-19 pandemic than White Americans. Hospitals are out of beds. Businesses are closed for good. Schools are caught in between. And while the vaccines provide so much hope, the rollout has been a dismal failure thus far. So I understand the despair and frustration of so many Americans and how they're feeling. I understand why many Governors, mayors, county officials, Tribal leaders feel like they're left on their own without a clear national plan to get them through the crisis. Let me be very clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The memorial we held 2 nights ago will not be our last one, unfortunately. The death toll will likely top 500,000 next month, and the cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point: Help is on the way. Today—today—I am unveiling a national strategy on COVID-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. This plan reflects the ideas I set forward during the campaign and further refined over the past 3 months. It consists of my transitions teams, the Task Force, Tony Fauci and the team here today, and other experts, who put this plan together. Our national strategy is comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it's detailed. You can review this entire plan—this entire plan—by going to whitehouse.gov. It is so detailed. It is over a hundred—it's 198 pages, and it's complete detail on what we're going to do. Our plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign to meet our goal of administering 100 million shots in our first hundred days in office. We're on day one. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our Nation has ever undertaken, and I'm committed to getting it done. We're committed to getting it done. And I explained—as I explained last week, we'll move Heaven and Earth to get more people vaccinated for free and create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms, and to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible. Yesterday we got started. We directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, with the goal of standing up 100 centers within the next month. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will launch the Federal pharmacy program to make vaccines available to communities and their local pharmacies beginning early—within—I think by the 7th or 8th of February, but in very early February. We'll also task the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare and expand the pool of medical professionals who can administer the vaccine—who can administer the vaccine—and to ensure we have enough vaccinators—the people doing the vaccines—to meet the Nation's needs and quickly. In addition to this effort, our administration will be asking Congress to fund—for the funds to grow the public health workforce. We also are going to take immediate steps to partner with Governors, mayors, and other local officials, who we've been talking to all along, who are on the frontlines of this fight. We directed FEMA to establish a COVID response liaison for each State, which means every State will have a point person at the Federal level to maximize cooperation between the Federal Government and the States. And where it falls short, to be made known about it—to be made known immediately. This is a model we used to respond to hurricanes—Hurricane Sandy, which I was deeply involved with. And in just a few moments, I'm going to sign a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing States 100 percent for the use of their national guards to help COVID relief efforts, something Democrats and Republican Governors alike have called for. But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. So while we increase vaccinations, we're going to take steps necessary now to slow the spread of the disease as well. One of our 100-day challenges is asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days—the next 99 days. The masks have become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act. But for a few months, to wear a mask—no vaccines—the fact is that they're the single best thing we can do. They're even more important than the vaccines—because they take time to work. And if we do this as Americans, the experts say, by wearing a mask from now until April, we'd save more than 50,000 lives going forward. Fifty thousand lives. So I'm asking every American to mask up for the next hundred days. Yesterday I signed an executive action that requires masks and social distancing on Federal property. Today we'll be signing an additional executive action to extend masking requirements on interstate travel, like on trains, planes, and buses. And in light of the new COVID variants that we're—you're learning about, we are instituting now a new measure for individuals flying into the United States from other countries. In addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country will need to test before they get on that plane, before they depart, and quarantine when they arrive in America. Our national plan launches a full-scale wartime effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment—syringes, needles—you name it. And when I say ""wartime,"" people kind of look at me, like, ""Wartime?"" Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. Four hundred thousand. And this is a wartime undertaking. Today I'm signing an executive action to use the Defense Production Act and all other available authorities to direct all Federal agencies and private industry to accelerate the making of everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. We're—we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them on—to move a plan forward. Now, look, our strategy includes a plan to safely reopen schools and businesses, while protecting our workers. Today we're directing the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services to immediately provide schools and communities with clear guidance and resources to safely reopen the schools and childcare centers. We're putting—and by the way, when you do that, think of all of the people who can get back to work, who will be able to get back to work—all the mothers and single fathers that are staying home, taking care of their children. We're going to put the full force of the Federal Government behind expanding testing by launching a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board. This effort will ensure that we get testing to where it is needed and where it's needed most, helping schools and businesses reopen safely, and protecting the most vulnerable, like those who live in long-term care facilities. And for the millions of workers—many of whom are people of color, immigrants, and low-wage workers—who continue to put their lives on the line to keep this country going through the pandemic, I am calling for the enforcement of more stringent worker safety standards so that you are better protected from this virus while you have to continue to work to protect the rest of us. Our plan also protects those most at risk and works for everyone of all races and in urban and rural communities alike. Today I'm formalizing the Health Equity Task Force that we announced in the transition, led by the brilliant Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who ensures that—is going to ensure that equality is at the core of every decision we make. That includes addressing vaccine hesitancy and building trust in communities, as well as fighting disinformation campaigns that are already underway. Above all, our plan is to restore public trust. We will make sure that science and public experts—scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you. That's why you're going to be hearing a lot more from Dr. Fauci again—and not from the President, but from the real genuine experts and scientists. We're going to make sure they work free from political interference, and that they make decisions strictly based on science and health care alone—science and health alone, not what the political consequences are. Vice President Harris and I and our entire administration will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. We will level with you when we make a mistake. We'll straight up say what happened. And I said at the outset: The honest truth is we're still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It's going to get worse before it gets better. It's going to take many months to get where we need to be. Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today—they don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after their exposure. Despite the best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you. But I also know: We can do this if we come together. That's why, ultimately, our plan is based on unity and all of us acting as one Nation. It requires families and neighbors looking out for one another; health care providers, and businesses, and civic and religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all relying together on a common purpose, with urgency and purpose and resolve. It requires reasserting our global leadership, which is why I took an action yesterday for the United States to rejoin the World Health Organization and to reestablish our Global Pandemic Office in the National Security Council. It requires Congress coming together to provide the necessary funding in the COVID-relief package and the American Rescue Plan that I will soon be sending to the Congress. I know these bold, practical steps will not come cheaply, but failing to do so will cost us so much more dearly. I look forward to working with Members of both parties in the Congress. We're in a national emergency, and it's time we treat it like one—together, with a national plan, as the United States of America. As I said yesterday in my Inaugural Address, there are moments in history when more is asked of a particular generation, more is asked of us as Americans than other times. We are in that moment now. History is going to measure whether we were up to the task. I believe we are. The American people have given so much already, but I believe they're ready to set big goals and pursue them with courage, conviction, and honesty because the health of the Nation is literally at stake. It's not hyperbole. I'm convinced the American people are ready, as well, to spare no effort, no expense to get this done. What could be more important? The more people we vaccinate and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us and the sooner we can build our economy back and build it back better and get back to our lives and to our loved ones. We can do this. We can do this if we stand together as fellow Americans, as the—and as the United States of America. So God bless those lost souls in this pandemic and their families, all they've left behind. May God bless all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as Americans. Thank you very much. Now I'm going to go over to this desk and sign these executive actions. But again, this is the plan. This is the plan. You can go online and get it. I know it's a lot of heavy reading, but it's all laid out in stark detail here. Thank you. This Executive order I'm signing is strengthening the supply chain. [At this point, the President signed an Executive order titled ""Sustainable Public Health Supply Chain.""] This next one is keeping workers safe, how to do that. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Protecting Worker Health and Safety.""] This next one is ensuring equitable response. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Ensuring an Equitable Pandemic Response and Recovery.""] I guess I should take these out this way, huh? The pens are going to pop on me. [Laughter] Can you give me a hand here? There you go. This next one is what I referenced about traveling to America. This is the promoting safe travel. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Promoting COVID-19 Safety in Domestic and International Travel.""] This next one is setting up the Pandemic Testing Board. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board and Ensuring a Sustainable Public Health Workforce for COVID-19 and Other Biological Threats."" An aide then retrieved the signed document.] Thank you. This next one is studying the safe schools initiative. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers.""] This next one is dictating the COVID data that has to be maintained and recorded. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Ensuring a Data-Driven Response to COVID-19 and Future High-Consequence Public Health Threats.""] The next one is making sure that the National Guard and FEMA support is available. [The President signed a memorandum to extend Federal support to Governors' use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and to increase reimbursement and other assistance provided to States.] The next one relates to expanding access to care and treatment for COVID-19. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Improving and Expanding Access to Care and Treatments for COVID-19.""] And the last one is our global response directive. [The President signed a national security directive on United States global leadership to strengthen the international COVID-19 response and to advance global health security and biological preparedness.] Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts  Q. Mr. President, you set the goal at 100 million vaccines in your first hundred days. Is that high enough? Shouldn't you set the bar higher? That's basically where the U.S. is right now. The President. When I announced it, you all said, ""It's not possible."" Come on, give me a break, man, will you? But it's a good start. One hundred million. Thank you."
"Jan 25, 2021",Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Enabling All Qualified Americans To Serve Their Country in Uniform,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. Vice President Harris and I just received a briefing from our economic team, and we remain in a once-in-a-century public health crisis that's led to the most unequal job and economic crisis in modern history. And the crisis is only deepening. It's not getting better; it's deepening. Yesterday we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment—900,000. They join millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. So many of them never thought they'd ever be out of work in the first place. And just like my dad did when he was—he used to lie awake at night when I was a kid, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep because he worried about whether or not he's about to lose his health care, or whether we were going to be—or have the money to pay the mortgage because of the economic circumstance he was in. And now, a lot of these folks are facing eviction or waiting hours in their cars—literally hours in their cars, waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank. It's the United States of America, and they're waiting to feed their kids. Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced, and they've—and they're barely hanging on and wondering what's next. Sometimes, the anxiety about what's going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened. But this is happening today, in America, and this cannot be who we are as a country. These are not the values of our Nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. They cannot watch people lose their jobs. And we have to act. We have to act now. It's not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve; this is an economic imperative. A growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans, not just for tomorrow, but in the future. There's a growing chorus of top economic—top economists that agree that in this moment of crisis, with this—with the interest rates as low as they are—historic lows—it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending. And they're more urgent than ever. You know, and that return on these investments and jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass the cost. If we don't act, the rest of the world is not standing still, in terms of the competitive advantage and the competitive possibilities, relative to us. That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable, according to these economists. And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a Nation and help us outcompete our competitors in the global economy, because we're going to grow the economy with these investments. While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was a first step, as I said at the time, it's just a downpayment. We need more action, and we need to move fast. Last week, I laid out a two-step plan of rescue and recovery to get through the crisis and to a better and stronger and more secure America. The first step of our American Rescue Plan is a plan to tackle the pandemic and get direct financial relief to Americans who need it the most. You know, in just a few days—it's just been a few days since I outlined this plan—it's received bipartisan support from a majority of American mayors and Governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that's needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance. In fact, an analysis by Moody's estimates that if we passed our American Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to the more than 18 million—I think it was 18,600,000—jobs that they believe would be created over the 4-year period, with our Build Back Better Recovery Plan. And with our American Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan. Even President Trump's—President Trump's now—not some liberal organization—President Trump's top former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said, quote, he ""absolutely is in favor"" of this rescue plan. This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it. We're seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step, a number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 National Strategy that I released yesterday—we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts on—us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools. I found it fascinating—yesterday the press asked the question: Is, you know, a hundred million enough? A week before, they were saying: ""Biden, are you crazy? You can't do hundred million in a hundred days."" Well, we're going to, God willing, not only do a hundred million, we're going to do more than that. But this is—we have to do this. We have to move. The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We're going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. Six hundred dollars, which was already passed, is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table. We'll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers, beyond the deadline that's now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans—14 million—have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months. So look, this would overwhelm emergency shelters and increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and are socially—can't socially distance. The American Rescue Plan asks Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard-hit families and tenants. This will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom-and-pop landlords who can't afford not to have the rent. But they can't wait. So, on Inauguration day, I directed my administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of States and cities and in Tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers. Police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses, they're all at the risk of losing their jobs. Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in the cities and towns. The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth. When you say ""small business,"" most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that hold—and they're important—but these small businesses hold the community—are the glue that hold these communities together. They are hurting badly, and they account for nearly half of the entire U.S. workforce. Nearly half. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest hit small businesses survive the pandemic and low-cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on. Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage, at 15—at least $15 an hour. No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. Fifteen dollars gets people above the poverty line. And we have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week—working—and some with two jobs, and they're still below the poverty line. Our plan includes access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly women, to get back to work, millions who are not working now because they don't have that care. All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That's 5 million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the Black community by one-third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 percent. I look forward to working with Members of Congress of both parties to move quickly to get this American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then, we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to the second step of our economic plan, the Build Back Better, the recovery plan. It's a plan that will make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy, and so much more that's going to create millions more jobs—good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs. But while we work with Members of both parties in the Congress, there are steps that we can and must take right now. For example, on Inauguration day, I directed my administration to pause student loan repayments for interest for—the interest payments for Americans with Federal student loans until at least September, so they're not going to have to pay until September. They still pay the bill, as it stands now, but they will not accrue interest, and they don't have to pay—begin to pay until September. And we may have to look beyond that, I might add. Today I'm signing an Executive order that directs the whole-of-Government—a whole-of-Government effort to help millions of Americans who are badly hurting. It requires all Federal agencies to do what they can do to provide relief to families, small businesses, and communities. And in the days ahead, I expect agencies to act. Let me touch on two ways these actions can help change Americans lives. We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America—one in seven—more than one in five Black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat. That includes nearly 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. And again, they're in this situation through no fault of their own. It's unconscionable. The American Rescue Plan provides additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for tens of millions of children and families to address this crisis. But families literally can't wait another day. As a result of the Executive order I'm going to shortly sign, the Department of Agriculture will consider taking immediate steps to make it easier for the hardest hit families to enroll and claim more generous benefits in the critical food and nutrition assistance area. This is going to help tens of millions of families, especially those who can't provide meals for their kids, who are learning remotely at home, are not receiving the regular meal plans that they have at school for breakfast or lunch. It's going to also—and we also need to protect the health and safety of the American worker. Right now approximately 40 percent of households in America have at least one member with a preexisting condition. Just imagine: You're out of work through no fault of your own. You file for unemployment while you're looking for a job. You find one, and you get an offer. But then, you find out there's a high risk of your getting infected with COVID-19 because of your condition. You and your loved one—and you and your loved ones have ever even greater risk of death and serious illness because of the preexisting conditions, so you turn it down. Right now, if you did that, you could be denied unemployment insurance because you're offered a job and you didn't take it. It's wrong. No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Because of the Executive order I'm about to sign, I expect the Department of Labor to guarantee the right to refuse unemployment—the employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so, you'll still be able to qualify for the insurance. That's a judgment the Labor Department will make. Look, there are just two consequential ways that the action I'm taking today will help people in need. Another way to help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial footing: by pausing Federal collections on overpayments and debts. Another makes sure that Federal contractors are receiving taxpayers' dollars, provide their workers with the pay and benefits they deserve. These are places where Federal tax dollars are administered—are being made available to build things from ships to staircases. And we let out—the Federal Government lets the contract—and we're going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America. And here's another: Right now there are up to 8 million people that are eligible for direct payments from the CARES Act and the relief bill passed in December. They're entitled to those payments, but there's not an easy way for those folks to assess—access them. So we're making it a priority today to fix that problem and get them relief they're entitled to. Look, I'm going to close and summarize this way: A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act. If—if we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run. That's what economists—left, right, and center—are telling us, both liberal and conservative. We'll be better and stronger across the board. If we act now, we'll be better able to compete with the world. If we act now, we'll be better able to meet our moral obligations to one another as Americans. I don't believe the people of this country just want to stand by and watch their friends and their neighbors, coworkers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes, or lose their sense of dignity and hope and respect—I don't believe that—especially in the middle of a pandemic that's so weakened and wreaked so much havoc and caused so much pain on America. That's not who we are. The bottom line is this: We're in a national emergency, and we need to act like we're in a national emergency. So we've got to move with everything we've got, and we've got to do it together. I don't believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs; I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs. And we have the tools to fix it. We have the tools to get through this. We have the tools to get this virus under control and our economy back on track. And we have the tools to help people. So let's use the tools, all of them. Use them now. So I'm going to sign this Executive order, but let me conclude again by saying: Folks, this is one of the cases where business, labor, Wall Street, Main Street, liberal, conservative, economists know we have to act now, not only to help who are in need now, but to allow us to be in the competitive position worldwide and be the leader of the world economy in the next year, and two, and three, and going forward. So thank you. I'm going to sign this Executive order. The first one is the economic relief related to COVID-19 pandemic. [At this point, the President signed the Executive order titled ""Economic Relief Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.""] The second one is protection—protecting the Federal workforce. [The President signed the Executive order titled ""Protecting the Federal Workforce.""] Thank you very much.  Senate Trial Concerning the Impeachment of Former President Donald J. Trump  Q. Mr. President, do you support Mitch McConnell's timeline for a February impeachment trial? The President. I haven't heard the detail of it, but I do think that having some time to get our administration up and running, we—they—I want to thank the Senate for passing our Secretary of Defense. It looks like our Secretary of Treasury, it looks like our Secretary of State is in place. So the more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better. Q. And, Mr. President, do you—[inaudible]—the filibuster?"
"Jan 25, 2021",Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers and an Exchange With Reporters,"Well, folks, thank you very much for being here. I'm about to sign an Executive order, but I want to begin by thanking the Vice President for helping this, but also thank Chairman Milley, who has been a great, great help, and then also the soon-to-be Secretary of Defense, who, when we can finish this, will be sworn in in a moment. And so, don't say anything to cause him to change his mind, okay? [Laughter] But all kidding aside, this is reinstating a position that previous commanders and—as well as the Secretaries have supported. And what I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform and, essentially, restoring the situation as it existed before, with transgender personnel, if qualified in every other way, can serve their Government in the United States military. So that's what I'm about to sign. And I'm going to get a chance, I'm told, a little later on another matter—later this afternoon when I speak to another order—to answer all your questions on a whole range of things. But I'm going to be going to the swearing-in shortly after this. Okay? Thank you, again. [At this point, the President signed the Executive order.] All right. Thank you."
"Jan 26, 2021",Remarks on Racial Justice and Equity and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. I'm going to make some brief remarks, sign an Executive order, and then take your questions, if that's okay with you all. Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we're getting to work to rebuild the backbone of America: manufacturing, unions, and the middle class. It's based on a simple premise: that we'll reward work, not wealth, in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be ""Made in America."" I've long said that I don't accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can't keep—can keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them. I don't buy for 1 second the—that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers' money to rebuild America. We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs. For example, the Federal Government every year spends approximately $600 billion in Government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there's a law that's been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that that money was spent—taxpayers' dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses. But the previous administration didn't take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the ""Buy American"" requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies for the products being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers' dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries. In 1918—excuse me, in 2018 alone, the Department spent $3 billion—the Defense Department—on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work. Under the previous administration, the Federal Government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30 percent. That is going to change on our watch. Today I'm taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better Recovery Plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know that previous Presidents entered office by promising to buy America and instituting the ""Buy American"" policy, but here's why this is different and not the same: I'll be signing an Executive order in just a moment, tightening the existing ""Buy American"" policies, and go further. We're setting clear directives and clear explanations. We're going to get to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort. Look, today I'm creating a Director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget who will oversee our all-of-Government ""Made in America"" initiative. That starts with stopping Federal agencies from waiving buy-in-America—""Buy American"" requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say ""We're not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we're going to buy a foreign product,"" they have to come to the White House and explain it to us. We're going to require that waivers be publicly posted; that is, if someone is seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility and is going to buy the following foreign parts, that waiver—the request for it—is going to be posted. Then, we'll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, ""Yes, I can do that here in my shop, in my town."" It's about—as you've heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete, who'd say, ""You've got to know how to know."" These small businesses don't even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and being able to be bought abroad. And I'm directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn't happened before. It will happen now. Here's what else we're going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better Recovery Plan, we'll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure, and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as make them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making us more competitive. It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well. We'll also make historic investments in research and development—hundreds of billions of dollars—to sharpen America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. The Federal Government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we're going to replace with clean, electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs—a million autoworker jobs in clean energy—and vehicles that are net-zero emissions. And together, this will be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since World War II. And with the Executive order I'll be signing today, we'll increase ""Buy American"" requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the Federal Government, you need to show that at least 50 percent of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50 percent to say ""Made in America,"" while the most valuable parts—the engines, the steel, the glass—are manufactured abroad. So basically—but basically, we're batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50 percent aren't high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn't account for U.S. jobs and economic activity. We're going to change that as well. The executive action I'm signing today will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported. At the same time, we'll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to Government procurement, to make sure we can use—we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains. And here's what else the action does. When we buy America, we'll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of Government procurement: Black, Brown, Native American small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a national network of manufacturers called a Manufacturing Extension Partnership, that's in all 50 States and Puerto Rico, to help Government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country. This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy. The Executive Action I am taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, you know, and our ports, especially those important for America's clean energy future and the development of offshore renewable energy. I'll close with this: The reason we need to do this is, America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. Our competitors aren't waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle class built this country, and we also know unions built the middle class. So let's invest in them once again. I know we're ready, despite all of the—all we're facing. I have never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today. Given even just half a chance, the American people, the American worker, has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That's what we're going to do. I'll stop here and sign the Executive order and then come back and take some of your questions. This Executive order is entitled ""Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans—All of American Workers."" [At this point, the President signed the Executive order.] There you go. Now I'd now be happy to take your questions. White House Director of Message Planning Meghan Hays. [Inaudible]—from AP. School Reopening Efforts/Reopening Businesses  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press. Two topics, if I may. The first: You have made reopening schools a central part of your first hundred days' agenda, and you've long portrayed yourself as an ally to the teachers and the unions. Right now the Chicago Teachers Union has refused. They defied an order to return to in-person classing—for in-person classrooms because of a lack of vaccinations. Do you believe, sir, that teachers should return to schools now? The President. I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers, and for the help that's in those schools maintaining the facilities. We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. And we need testing for teachers, as well as students. And we need the capacity: the capacity to know that, in fact, the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone. For example, there is no reason why—the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the lavatories to the hallways. And so this is about making—and none of the school districts that I'm aware of—there may be some, of public school districts—have insisted that all of those pieces be in place. And, I might add, it's the same kind of thing I hope we can do with small businesses and businesses, making sure they have the capacity to test their workers when they come in; to make sure they have plastic dividers in between their booths in their restaurants, et cetera; to make sure they can sanitize. So it's not so much about the idea that teachers aren't going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and as safe as we can rationally make it. And we can do that, and we should be able to open up every school, kindergarten through eighth grade, if, in fact, we administer these tests. And it will have the added advantage, I might add, of putting millions of people back to work, all those mothers and fathers that are home taking care of their children, rather than go to work. Even when they can work, they're not able to do it unless they have the luxury of working distance-wise, like many of us do. They're not able to do it. And so this is about generating economic growth overall as well. Director Hays. Great. Alex from Reuters. Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Alex Alper from Reuters. I wanted to ask a question about Navalny—if you are considering imposing sanctions on any of the individuals involved in his attempted poisoning and/or his arrest when he returned from Germany. And if not, is that related to your concerns about it potentially derailing a New START extension? Thank you. The President. I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's the SolarWinds, or whether it's the reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan. I have asked the agencies in question to do a thorough read for me on every one of those issues, to update me on precisely where they are. And I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians. Director Hays. Geoff [Geoff Bennett, NBC News] from NBC. Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Q. President Biden, Vice President Harris, a question about your COVID relief deal. On Friday, you said the Nation is ""in a national emergency [and] we should act like it."" Given that—given the scale and the severity of the need, how long are you willing to get sufficient Republican support before you would greenlight Democrat attempts to use reconciliation, for instance, to pass that bill? The President. Well, look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate. But here's the deal: I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works. And what I'm not—I can't guarantee anything at all, but I can say that what I'm going to be doing—and we've already begun—is making it clear to the leadership in the House and the Senate, as well as the—the group of 16—it's a group, a bipartisan group, as well as Republican individuals who have an interest in the issues that are in that—my package, and saying ""Here's what I'm doing, and here's why I want to do it, here's why I think we need to do it, and what kind of support can or can't you give to that?"" And then, we go on to the way in which we deal with legislation all the time. You know, we didn't have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and I came into office. We were short three votes. We didn't know we had the votes until the day of the—bringing it up. And—but here's the deal: You know, it's interesting—and I know you ask a lot of these questions. You know the answers, but you have to, to help educate the public as well; I'm not suggesting you don't know what I'm about to say. No one wants to give up on their position until there's no other alternative. They either have to make a decision that they don't do what—they don't support what is being proposed, or they insist on what they have, or they let it all go away, fall down. I think we're far from that point right now. The decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go. And let me make clear about negotiations: I've always believed part of negotiation—on the part of a President and/or of a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed—is about consultation. It's not enough for me just to come up to you and say: ""I like this. I expect you to support it."" I want to explain to you why I think it's so important in this package that we have to provide for money for additional vaccines, why I think it's so important why we provide for money to extend unemployment benefits, why I think it's so important that we provide money to provide for the ability of people not to be thrown out of their apartments during this pandemic because they can't afford their rent, and to make the case to you why I think and what I think the priorities within this piece—that we think the priorities are—I apologize—were within this legislation. And I don't expect we'll know whether we have an agreement or to what extent the entire package will be able to pass or not pass until we get right down to the very end of this process, which will be probably in a couple of weeks. But the point is, this is just the process beginning. Director Hays. Annie, the Washington Post. Q. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, Annie Linskey with the Washington Post. The President. Hi, Annie. Political Unity/The President's Agenda  Q. I wanted to ask you a little bit about one of the, sort of, major themes of your campaign, and how you sort of intend to measure and enact it—and that is the idea of unity. If you could talk a little bit about what you see unity as being? There are some people who are defining it as being bipartisan. Others are saying it is what most of the people in the country, defined by some poll, might believe, or any sort of number of other—or perhaps it's 50 plus 1, or 50 plus 2, or 75 percent. So, given that it is such a key part of your message and your promise, can you talk and reflect a little bit more about what is unity when you see it and as you define it? The President. Well, Annie, I think it makes up several of the issues—the points you made. One is: Unity requires you to take away—eliminate the vitriol, make anything that you disagree with about the other person's personality or their lack of integrity or they're not decent legislators and the like—so we have to get rid of that. And I think that's already beginning to change, but God knows where things go, number one. Unity also is: trying to reflect what the majority of the American people—Democrat, Republican, and Independent—think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better. For example, if you look at the data—and I'm not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have—I think it's—I hope I'm saying this correct—you may correct me if I get the number wrong, I think it's 57, 58 percent of the American people—including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents—think that we have to do something about the COVID vaccine; we have to do something about making sure that people who are being—hurting badly, can't eat, don't have food, are in a position where they're about to be thrown out of their apartments, et cetera, being able to have an opportunity to get a job—that they all think we should be acting, we should be doing more. Unity also is trying to get, at a minimum—if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines but it gets passed, it doesn't mean there wasn't unity; it just means it wasn't bipartisan. I'd prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I'm trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the—how can I say it?—the vitriol out of all of this. Because I'm confident—I'm confident—from my discussions, there are a number of Republicans who know we have to do something about the food insecurity for people in this pandemic. I'm confident they know we have to do something about figuring out how to get children back in school. There's just—there's easy ways to deal with this. One, if you're anti-union, you can say it's all because of teachers. If you want to make a case though that it's complicated, you say, ""Well, what do you have to do to make it safe to get in those schools?"" Now, we're going to have arguments. For example, you know I proposed that we—because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage—the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks. Well, there's legitimate reason for people to say, ""Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over x number of dollars or y?"" I'm open to negotiate those things. That's all. I picked it because I thought it was rational, reasonable, and it had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House when it passed. But this is all a bit of a moving target in terms of the precision with which this goes. You're asking about unity: 51 votes, bipartisan, et cetera. The other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we're not only going to, sort of, stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession, moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity, is to spend money now to—from—across the board, every major institution has said, ""If we don't invest now, we're going to lose so much altitude, in terms of our employment base and our economic growth, it's going to be harder to reestablish it."" We can afford to do it now. As a matter of fact, the—I think the response has been: ""We can't afford not to invest now. We can't afford to fail to invest now."" And I think there's a growing realization of that on the part of all but some very, very hard-edged partisans, maybe on both sides, but I think there is a growing consensus. Whether we get it all done exactly the way I want it remains to be seen, but I'm confident that we can work our way through. We have to work our way through because, as I've said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus. Other- —otherwise it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that are—get us virtually nowhere. I don't want to hold the—my colleague may know, the Vice President—but you know, I think there were very few debates on the Senate floor the whole last year—— Vice President Kamala D. Harris. That's correct. The President. ——on almost any issue. Well, that benefits no one. It doesn't inform anybody. It doesn't allow the public to make judgments about who they think is right or wrong. So I am optimistic that it may take some time, but over the year, the way—if we treat each other with respect—and we're going to argue like hell. [Laughter] I'm confident of that. Believe me, I know that. I've been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can get things done for the American people. Director Hays. Great. Last question. Josh [Josh Wingrove] from Bloomberg. Q. Thank you. The President. Josh, they don't trust you with the mike, huh? I don't know, man. Economic Stimulus Legislation/Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment  Q. No, that's fine. I wouldn't either. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you taking the questions. You mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks. Can I ask whether it's more important for you to get something passed in a short timeframe like that or would you be willing to wait longer to get more bipartisan support? And might I also ask that—one of the pillars is the vaccine funding—when do you think any American who wants to get the shot will be able to get the shot? The President. Well, I'll try to answer the three parts to your question as I heard them. One, time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. And I must tell you, I'm reluctant to cherry pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again to—because these all are kind of—they go, sort of, hand in glove, each of these issues. Number one. Number two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine and in very short order. We, as you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was held—being held in abeyance or available. Now that we're here—we've been around a week or so—we now have that. And we've gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road. So I'm quite confident that we will be in a position, within the next 3 weeks or so, to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that. That is my—I promised that we would get at least a hundred million vaccinations—that's not people, because sometimes you need more than one shot of the vaccination. But 100,000—a hundred million shots in people's arms of the vaccine. I think, with the grace of God, and the good will of the neighbor, and the creek not rising, as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 150—1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day. But we have to meet that goal of a million a day. And everything points that we're going to have: A, the—enough vaccine; B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm the vaccine; three, a number of vaccinators, people administering the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have—those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals—they have people do it, but they don't have the capacity to do everyone. And so I think we're going to have—we're leaning hard on—into areas where we can produce more vaccinators. We feel confident we can do that. And thirdly, it's really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for 8 hours—being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera. All those mechanical things are really—they sound simple, but they're all consequential when we're trying to get out a minimum of 100 million vaccinations in 100 days and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people. Does that answer your question? Q. Well, my question was at what date—or, roughly, when do you think anyone who wants one would be able to get it? Is it summer? Is it fall? The President. Oh, I—no, I think it will be this spring. I think we'll be able to do that this spring. And—but it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country, but I think we can do that. I feel confident that, by summer, we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren't on the first—aren't on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that. But I feel good about where we're going, and I think we can get it done. Director Hays. Thank you, guys. Q. One more. One more on vaccines. Mr. President, one more on vaccines. The President. Now, wait, wait, wait. I know he always asks me tough questions—[laughter]—and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway. So go ahead and answer—ask the question. Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Coronavirus Response Efforts  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. So you just said that you think within 3 weeks or so we'll be at the point where there are a million vaccines per day, but it seems like— The President. No, I think we'll get there before that. I said, ""I hope""—I misspoke. I hope we'll be able to increase as we go on until we get to the million-five a day. That's my hope. Q. And then, my—the follow-up to that would be: Now that you're President and you're saying, ""There is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,"" what happened to 2 months ago when you were talking declaratively about ""I'm going to shut down the virus""? The President. Well, I'm going to shut down the virus, but not—I never said I'd do it in 2 months. I said it took a long time to get here; it's going take a long time to beat it. And so we have millions of people out there who are—who have the virus. We're just, for the first day, I think—correct me if I'm wrong; I've been doing other things this morning, speaking with foreign leaders. But one of the things—I think this is one of the first days that the number has actually come down—the number of deaths—and the number on a daily basis, and the number of hospitalizations, et cetera. It's going to take time. It's going to take a heck of a lot of time. And we still have—as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it's one thing when we have mass—how can I say it politely?—mass disregard of the warnings about not wearing masks and wearing masks and social distancing and failure to social distance and people getting together on holidays in ways that weren't recommended, et cetera. We see—the first thing that happens is, we see the number of infections go up. Then, you see the hospitalizations go up. Then, you see the deaths go up. And so we're in this for a while. I mean, we're—what are we now? At about 410,000 deaths. And there's going to be more. The prediction, as I said from the very beginning to getting here as—after being sworn in, was—the predictions were: We're going to see somewhere between a total of 600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way. So—and again, remember: The vaccine—most of the people taking the vaccine—a vast, significant number—required two shots, and they're an average of 3 weeks apart. And it takes time for it to be sure that you're—you get to that 95-percent assurance rate. And so it's beginning to move. But I'm confident we will beat this. We will beat this. But we're still going to be talking about this in the summer. We're still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall. And last point I'll make—and I know you're tired of hearing me saying it, particularly—you may be tired of me saying it. [Laughter] And that is that if we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives—50,000 people—who otherwise would die. Thank you so very much."
"Jan 26, 2021",Remarks on Efforts To Contain the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The President. Good afternoon, folks. I thank the Vice President for being with me today as well. In my campaign for President, I made it very clear that the moment had arrived as a Nation where we face deep racial inequities in America and systemic racism that has plagued our Nation for far, far too long. I said it over the course of the past year that the blinders had been taken come off the Nation of the American people. What many Americans didn't see, or had simply refused to see, couldn't be ignored any longer. Those 8 minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around—all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn't be forgotten. It stirred the conscience and—of tens of millions of Americans, and in my view, it marked a turning point in this country's attitude toward racial justice. When his 6-year-old daughter Gianna, who I met with when I met with the family—I leaned down to say hi to her, and she said—looked at me, and she said, ""Daddy changed the world."" That's what Gianna said, his daughter. ""Daddy changed the world."" And I believe she is right, not because this kind of injustice stopped—it clearly hasn't—but because the ground has shifted, because it's changed minds and mindsets, because it laid the groundwork for progress. COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America—but no one has been spared—but the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning. Just look at the numbers: 40 percent of frontline workers—nurses, first responders, grocery store workers—are Americans of color, and many are still living on the edge. One in ten Black Americans is out of work today. One in eleven Latino Americans is out of work today. One in seven households in America—about one in four Black, one in five Latino households in America—report that they don't have enough food to eat in the United States of America. Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of White Americans. And it's not White Americans' fault, but it's just a fact. And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans. One of the reasons I'm so optimistic about this Nation is that today's generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen. And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economic—excuse me, economic inequity between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate; and yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and White supremacy. It's just been weeks since all of America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists, and White supremacists violently attack the Capitol of our democracy. And so now, now is the time to act. It's time to act because that's what the faith and morality calls us to do. Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold: We're all God's children; we should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves. And this is time to act—and this time to act is because it's what the core values of this Nation call us to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—share these values and want us to act as well. We've never fully lived up to the founding principles of this Nation—to state the obvious—that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives. And it's time to act now, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because if we do, we'll all be better off for it. For too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this Nation to fester. You know, we've bought the view that America is a zero-sum game in many cases: ""If you succeed, I fail."" ""If you get ahead, I fall behind."" ""If you get the job, I lose mine."" Maybe worst of all, ""If I hold you down, I lift myself up."" We've lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, ""A rising tide lifts all boats."" And when we lift each other up, we're all lifted up. You know, and the corollary is true as well: When any one of us is held down, we're all held back. More and more economic studies in recent years have proven this, but I don't think you need economic studies to see the truth. Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to underresourced schools, we gave each and every 3- and 4-year-old child a chance to learn, to go to school—not daycare, to school—and grow and thrive in school and throughout. When they've done that—the places it's been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well. But you know, does anyone in this whole Nation think we're not all better off if that were to happen? Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth—who made it possible for them buy a home, their first home—and begin to build equity to provide for their families and send their children off to school, does anyone doubt that the whole Nation will be better off? Just imagine: Instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities. Does anyone doubt this whole Nation wouldn't be better off? Just imagine if more incredibly creative and innovative—how much more creative and innovative we'd be if this Nation held the Historic Black Colleges and Universities to the same opportunities—and minority-serving institutions—that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future. You know, just ask the first HBCU graduate elected as Vice President if that's not true. But to do this, I believe this Nation and this Government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equality—equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn't nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of Government; it has to be the business of the whole of Government. That's why I issued, among the first days, my whole-of-Government Executive order that will, for the first time, advance equity for all throughout our Federal policies and institutions. It focuses on the full range of communities who have been long underserved and overlooked: people of color; Americans with disabilities; LGBTQ Americans; religious minorities; rural, urban, suburban communities facing persistent poverty. And I've asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administration's charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council because I know we'll—she'll see it through. Every White House, every White House component, and every agency will be involved in this work because advancing equity has to be everyone's job. Today I'll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work. Housing, for example: Housing is a right in America, and homeownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations. Today I'm directing the Department of Housing and urban affairs—and Urban Development to redress historical racism in Federal housing policies. Today I'm directing the Federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian Tribes. Respect the Tribal sovereignty—respect for Tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities. This builds on the work we did last week to expand Tribes' access to the Strategic National Stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic. Today I'm directing Federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable, and it's un-American. I've asked the Department of Justice to strengthen its partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes. I've also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for combating xenophobia in our national response to COVID. Look, in the weeks ahead, I'll be reaffirming the Federal Government's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and accessibility, building on the work we started in the Obama-Biden administration. That's why I rescinded the previous administration's harmful ban on diversity and sensitivity training and abolished the offensive, counterfactual 1776 Commission. Unity and healing must begin with understanding and truth, not ignorance and lies. Today I'm also issuing an Executive order that will ultimately end the Justice Department's use of the private prison industry—private prisons, an industry that houses pretrial detainees and Federal prisoners. The Executive order directs the Attorney General to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities, a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration. This is the first step to stop corporations from profiteering off of incarcerating—incarceration that is less humane and less safe, as the studies show. And it is just the beginning of my administration's plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system. Here's another thing that we need to do: We need to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act—named after our dear friend, John Lewis—and continue to fight back against laws that many States are engaged in to suppress the right to vote, while expanding access to the ballot box for all eligible voters. Because here's the deal, and I'll close with this: I ran for President because I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this Nation. And the simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. We can't eliminate it if—it's not going to be overnight. We can't eliminate everything. But it's corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. It costs every American, not just who have felt the sting of racial injustice. We aren't just less of a—we are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemic racism; we're also less prosperous, we're less successful, we're less secure. So we must change, and I know it's going to take time. But I know we can do it. And I firmly believe the Nation is ready to change, but Government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day: today, tomorrow, and every day. Now I'm going to sign these executive actions to continue the work to make real the promise of America for every American. Again, I'm not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you: We're going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism, and every branch of the White House and the Federal Government is going to be part of that effort. Thank you. Okay. This first Executive order is a memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to redress our Nation's and the Federal Government's history of discriminatory housing practices and policies. [At this point, the President signed a memorandum on redressing our Nation's and the Federal Government's history of discriminatory housing practices and policies.] The next Executive order is reforming the incarceration system by eliminating the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Reforming Our Incarceration System To Eliminate the Use of Privately Operated Criminal Detention Facilities.""] The third Executive order is a memorandum for the heads of Executive departments and agencies: Tribal consultation and strengthening nation-to-nation relationships. [The President signed a memorandum on Tribal consultation and strengthening nation-to-nation relationships.] The last Executive order is condemning and combating racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. [The President signed a memorandum on condemning and combating racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States.] I think the country is ready, and I know this administration is ready. Thank you. President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia  Q. Mr. President, what did you talk to Vladimir Putin about? The President. You. [Laughter] He sent his best."
"Jan 27, 2021","Remarks on Efforts To Combat Climate Change, Create Jobs, and Promote Scientific Integrity","Thank you for taking the time to be here. Good afternoon. I'm accompanied by Jeff Zients, who is heading up our whole COVID team. And today what I'd like to do is to upgrade—update you on where we are. Tomorrow we're going to begin the briefings that are going to occur on a regular basis with Mr. Zients and his team. So we're bringing back the pros to talk about COVID in an unvarnished way. Any questions you have, that's how we'll handle them, because we're letting science speak again. And so I'd like to update you on the aggressive steps we're taking to meet our goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots within a hundred days and to ramp up the vaccine supply as fast as we can. This will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we've ever undertaken as a nation. I've said that before, but I must say it again because we're going to do—we're going to do everything we can to get it done. But a lot of things can go wrong along the way. And so I've—as I've said in the past, we want to give credit to everyone involved in this vaccine effort and the prior administration and the science community and the medical sphere—— [At this point, technical equipment falling to the floor could be heard off camera.] ——for getting the program—I didn't do it, I promise—[laughter]—for getting the program off the ground. And that credit is absolutely due. But it's also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final days of the transition—and it wasn't until the final days we got the kind of cooperation we needed—that once we arrived, the vaccine program is in worse shape than we anticipated or expected. A lot of you who follow this—and nobody is—I mean this sincerely, the press is the smartest group of people in town; you hone this stuff down, clearly—I think you found the same thing. Even before I took office, I announced a new vaccine—a vaccination strategy which centers on Federal leadership and execution for our whole country. And that's why I directed my COVID team to go to work immediately on how we could step up the vaccination efforts and the vaccinations. I'm pleased to announce the first progress in that work today on day 7 of my Presidency. First, after review of the current vaccine supply and manufacturing plants, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distribution to States, Tribes, and Territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses, starting next week. That's an increase of 1.4 million doses per week. And you all know—if I may note, parenthetically—you all know that the vaccines are distributed to States based on population. They're based on population. And so the smaller the State, the less vaccine; the bigger the State, the more they get. And so this is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. We've got a long way to go though. The second thing: We're increasing the transparency with States, cities, and Tribes, and local partners when it comes to the vaccine supply. This is something we've heard over and over again from both Democrats and Republicans, State and local leaders: that they need a plan in order to what—they didn't know what they had to plan on. They need to know what the order is going to be. Jeff had a meeting with the Governors on Zoom and—and others. And I think we're getting this coordinated in a way that there's increased cooperation and confidence. But until now, we've had to guess how much vaccine to expect for the next week. And that's what the Governors had to do: ""How much am I getting next week?"" This is unacceptable. They—you know, the lives are at stake here. From this week forward, God willing, we'll ensure that States, Tribes, and Territories will now always have a reliable 3-week forecast on what the supply they're going to get. So they'll know, 3 weeks ahead of time, what's going to be there in the third week. This is going to help make sure Governors, mayors, and local leaders have greater certainty around supply so they can carry out their plans to vaccinate as many people as possible. So we will both increase the supply in the short term by more than 15 percent and give our States and local partners more certainty about when the deliveries will arrive. These two steps are going to help increase our prospects of hitting and—or exceeding, God willing, the ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. But I also want to be clear: 100 million shots in 100 days is not the endpoint; it's just the start. We're not stopping there. The end goal is to beat COVID-19. And the way we do that is to get more people vaccinated, which means we have to be ready, after we hit the ground—we have to hit the goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. Now, that means fewer than 100 million people getting totally vaccinated; it means 100 [million]* shots, and it means somewhere between 60—maybe less, maybe more—million people will have the—because it requires two shots in many cases, not always. So today I'm directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients, here, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our total supply of vaccine for the American people. And we believe that we'll soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional hundred billion [million]* doses for each of the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. That's 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna, 200 million more doses than the Federal Government had previously secured. Not in hand yet, but ordered. We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer. And some of it will come as early—begin to come in early summer, but by the mid—by the midsummer, that this vaccine will be there. And the order—and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by 50 percent—from 400 million ordered to 600 million. This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall. But we want to make—look, that's—I want to repeat: It will be enough to fully vaccinate 300 [million]* Americans to beat this pandemic—300 million Americans. And this is aggregate plan that doesn't leave anything on the table or anything to chance, as we've seen happen in the past year. I've said before: This is a wartime effort. When I say that, people ask, ""Wartime?"" I say, ""Yes, more than 400,000 Americans have already died."" I think it's four-hundred-eleven or -twelve [thousand]* have died in one year of this pandemic—more than all the people who died in all of—Americans who died in World War II. This is a wartime undertaking; it's not hyperbole. And as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all the authorities I have under the Defense Production Act, and expedite these vaccines. And we're using the Defense Production Act to launch a full-scale, wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from the previous administration. We're going to be working across the Government, with private industry, to ramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment—the syringes, the needles, the gloves, the swabs, the masks—everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. Well, we've already identified suppliers, and we're working with them to move our plan forward. The biggest problem—I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summer that: ""You have too much vaccine left over. You have too much equipment leftover."" That's not my worry. I hope that becomes the problem, rather than we somehow find interruptions in supply or access. These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms. We've directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that work is underway. We're working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies, beginning in early February; it's a couple weeks off. And we—that will enormously expand our reach. Last week, I also signed a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing States 100 percent for the uses of their National Guard to help the COVID relief effort, both getting people—getting the sites set up and even using some of their personnel to administer some of the vaccines. And I think it's something Democrats and Republicans and Governors alike have called for. We're also expanding testing, which will help schools and businesses reopen safely and protect the most vulnerable. And we formalized the Health Equity Task Force to ensure that equity is at the core of everything we do in urban and rural communities alike, to make sure those people most significantly damaged have—have access. Access. We have to change. We have to move in a direction for those communities that are hard to get to. But the brutal truth is: It's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. Months. In the next few months, masks—not vaccines—are the best defense against COVID-19. Experts say that wearing masks from now just until April would save 50,000 lives who otherwise will pass away if we don't wear these masks. That's why I'm asking the American people to mask up for the first hundred days. I've issued Executive orders requiring masks on Federal property and interstate travel: trains and planes and buses. One Congressman pointed out—I could—well, he used a very, anyway, colorful term to say wearing a mask—""I tell him to kiss my ear; I'm not going to wear a mask."" Well, guess what? Not very American. The fact is, you want to be patriotic; you're going to protect people. And new COVID-19 variants are—we are instituting new measures to deal with these individuals flying into the United States from other countries. You've all hold—if you could hold a second—you've all heard about the strain—the British strain, the Brazilian strain, the South African strain. And they are—they seem to be more transmittable more easily. So, in addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country, we need to test before they get on that plane and self-quarantine when they arrive in America. I'm going to close with this: I now have a national—we now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's comprehensive. It's based on science, not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. And it is detailed. It's going to require Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to provide funding to administer the vaccines, to ramp up testing, to help schools and businesses reopen, and to deliver immediate economic relief to Americans who are in—badly in need of it through no fault of their own. And our plan will take time. Progress from our plan will take time to measure, as people getting infected today don't show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from those—from the disease die weeks after that exposure. You know, despite the best—our best intentions, we're going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you and acknowledge. And let me be clear: Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month—this February—and cases will continue to mount. We didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear: We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way. We can do this if we come together, if we listen to the scientists. And as I said: Tomorrow, I say to the press, the entire team will be back in the business of—my COVID team—of answering all your detailed questions. So thank you very much for your patience. Keep the faith. We're going to get this done. And I'll always level with you about the state of affairs. Thank you."
"Jan 28, 2021",Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a Memorandum on Protecting Women's Health at Home and Abroad and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, everybody. I know the press has just had a long session with the team here about what I'm going to be talking about today and this afternoon. And let me just start by saying, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the three people standing next to me here for what they've agreed to do to help, particularly my best buddy, John Kerry. Asking a former Secretary of State to come back and do this has been a—I know it was a big ask on the part of myself. I was going to blame Kamala for it as well, but for both of us. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Why not? [Laughter] The President. And—but John has been deeply involved; the Secretary has been deeply involved in climate issues as a Senator and one of the leaders, legislatively, as well. And I don't think anybody knows more about the issue and the damage that's been done by some of the Executive orders of the previous administration. And Gina—you've run everything, Gina. Thank you very much. Let me get to it. Today is ""Climate Day"" at the White House and—which means that today is ""Jobs Day"" at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor. And we're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security and America leading the world in a clean energy future. It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we—that's now facing us—climate change—with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can't wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it's time to act. And I might note, parenthetically: If you notice, the attitude of the American people toward greater impetus on focusing on climate change and doing something about it has increased across the board: Democrat, Republican, Independent. It's—that's why I'm signing today an Executive Order to supercharge our administration's ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change. It is an existential threat. Last year, wildfires burned more than 5,000 acres in the West—as no one knows better than the Vice President, a former Senator from California—an area roughly the size of the entire State of New Jersey. More intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled States across the Gulf Coast and along the East Coast—I can testify to that, from Delaware. Historic floods, severe droughts have ravaged the Midwest. More Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, coastlines, and in farmlands, in red States and blue States. And the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of the military's operational critical installations. Two thirds. And so this could—we could—this could well be on the conservative side. And many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once. It's not just the pandemic that keeps people inside; it's poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. And just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis. We must keep—we must lead global response because neither challenge can be met, as Secretary Kerry has pointed out many times, by the United States alone. We know what to do; we've just got to do it. When we think of climate change, we think of it—this is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one in the same. When I think of climate change, I think of—and the answers to it—I think of jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better Recovery Plan is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs, not 7, 8, 10, 12 dollars an hour, but prevailing wage and benefits. You know, we can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. We've already reached a point where we're going to have to live with what it is now. That's going to require a lot of work all by itself, without it getting any worse. When we think of renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. And I want to parenthetically thank the Secretary of Agriculture for helping to put together that program during the campaign. We see small business and master electricians designing, installing, and innovating energy-conserving technologies and building homes and buildings. And we're going to reduce electric consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs in the process. And when the previous administration reversed the Obama-Biden vehicle standard and picked Big Oil companies over American workers, the Biden-Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we'll set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see these workers building new buildings, installing 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations across the country as we modernize our highway systems to adapt to the changes that have already taken place. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives and the residents of our cities and towns breathing cleaner air and fewer kids living with asthma and dying from it. And not only that, the Federal Government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know. With today's Executive order, combined with the ""Buy American"" Executive order I signed on Monday, we're going to harness the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy clean, zero-emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. With everything I just mentioned, this will mean 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry—1 million. And we'll do another thing: We'll take steps towards my goal of achieving 100-percent carbon-pollution-free electric sector by 2035. Transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be a tremendous spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and to our environment. Already, 84 percent of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this is year is clean energy. Clean energy. Why? Because it's affordable; because it's clean; because, in many cases, it's cheaper. And it's the way we're keeping up—they're keeping up. We're going to need scientists, the national labs, land-grant universities, Historical Black Colleges and Universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit clean electric—clean electricity across distances and battery technology and a whole range of other things. We need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We need iron workers and welders to install them. Technologies they invent, design, and build will ultimately become cheaper than any other kind of energy, helping us dramatically expand our economy and create more jobs with a cleaner, cleaner environment. And we'll become the world's largest exporter of those technologies, creating even more jobs. You know, we are also—we're going to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that are going to benefit communities three times over: one, by alleviating affordable—the affordable housing crisis; two, by increasing energy efficiency; and, three, by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. We're also going to create more than a quarter-million jobs to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. They're abandoned wells that are open now, and we're going to put people to work. They're not going to lose jobs in these areas, they're going to create jobs. They're going to get prevailing wage to cap those over a million wells. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions, and we know how to do this. The Obama-Biden administration reduced the auto industry—rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We need solar energy cost-competitive with traditional energy, weatherizing more—we made them cost-competitive, weatherizing more than a million homes. The Recovery Act of our administration—the last administration—our administration, the Democratic administration made record clean energy investments: $90 billion. The President asked me to make sure how that money was spent, on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. Now, the Biden-Harris administration is going to do it again and go beyond. The Executive order I'll be signing establishes a White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy. And it will be led by one of America's most distinguished climate leaders, former EPA Director Gina McCarthy. As the head of the new office and my National Climate Adviser, Gina will chair a National Climate Task Force, made up of many members of our Cabinet, to deliver a whole-of-Government approach to the climate crisis. This is not—it's not time for small measures; we need to be bold. So let me be clear: That includes helping revitalize the economies of coal, oil, and gas, and power plant communities. We have to start by creating new, good-paying jobs, capping those abandoned wells, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites into new hubs of economic growth, creating new, good-paying jobs in those communities where those workers live because they helped build this country. We're never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the Nation. We're going to do right by them, make sure they have opportunities to keep building the Nation and their own communities and getting paid well for it. While the whole-of-Government approach is necessary, though, it's not sufficient. We're going to work with mayors and Governors and Tribal leaders and business leaders who are stepping up and the young people organizing and leading the way. My message to those young people is: You have your—the full capacity and power of the Federal Government. Your Government is going to work with you. Now, today's Executive order also directs the Secretary of the Interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, wherever possible. We're going to review and reset the oil and gas leasing program. Like the previous administration, we'll start to properly manage—unlike it, we're going to start to properly manage lands and waterways in ways that allow us to protect, preserve them—the full value that they provide for us for future generations. Let me be clear, and I know this will—always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking. We'll protect jobs and grow jobs, including through stronger standards, like controls from methane leaks and union workers in—willing to install the changes. Unlike previous administrations, I don't think the Federal Government should give handouts to Big Oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies. And I'm going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies. We're going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America, millions of jobs in wind, solar, and carbon capture. In fact, today's actions are going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands. It establishes a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps—that I called for when I was campaigning—to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. Look, this Executive order I'm signing today also makes it official that climate change will be at the center of our national security and foreign policy. As Secretary Kerry—as our Special Presidential Envoy for Climate—with him, the world knows how serious I am about one of America's—by appointing one of America's most distinguished statesmen and one of my closest friends, speaking for America on one of the most pressing threats of our time. John was instrumental in negotiating the Paris Climate Agreement that we started to—that we rejoined—this administration rejoined on day one, as I promised. And today's Executive order will help strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I'll convene to address this climate crisis on Earth Day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security and risk assessment and analysis will also be included. With this Executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color—so-called ""fenceline communities""—especially those communities—Brown, Black, Native American, poor Whites. It's hard—the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or the Route 9 corridor in the State of Delaware. That's why we're going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key Federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a Nation and increases the health of everybody. Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our Federal response to the climate crisis. Earlier this month, I nominated Dr. Eric Lander, a brilliant scientist who is here today, to be the Director of the Office of Science and Technology. I also nominated another brilliant scientist, Dr. Frances Arnold and Dr. Maria Zuber, to co-chair the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology—so-called ""PCAST""—that President Eisenhower started 6 weeks after the launch of Sputnik. It's a team of America's top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions: ""What next? What's the next big breakthrough?"" And then, helping us make the impossible possible. Today I'm signing a Presidential memorandum making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the Vice President, and the American people. To summarize, this Executive order—it's about jobs—good-paying union jobs. It's about workers building our economy back better than before. It's a whole-of-Government approach to put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It's advancing conservation; revitalizing communities and cities and in the—on the farmlands; and securing environmental justice. Our plans are ambitious, but we are America. We're bold. We are unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science and discovery. We can do this, we must do this, and we will do this. I'm now going to sign the Executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity. And I want to thank you all. I'm going to go over and sign that now. I'll use the right pens here. The first order I'm signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad. [At this point, the President signed an Executive order titled ""Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.""] This next one: restoring trust in Government through science and integrity and evidence-based policy making. [The President signed a memorandum on restoring trust in Government through scientific integrity and evidence-based policymaking.] One more here. And this last one is the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, establishing. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.""] I thank you all for your time. Q. Sir, what types of sacrifices are you asking Americans to make?"
"Jan 29, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Since we are socially distanced, I think I can take my mask off to make this very brief announcement. I know that you've been briefed by the health care team about what this is about. And there is an easy and quick way for us to describe this. It's been a busy week, and I've signed Executive orders tackling COVID-19, the economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial equity. But today I'm about to sign two Executive orders that are—basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became President, which by fiat he changed—made more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items: the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid. And the second order I'm going to be signing also changes what the President has done—the President—what the former President has done. And it—a memorandum reversed the—my predecessor's attack on women's health—— [At this point, the President coughed.] ——excuse me—health access. And as we continue to battle COVID-19, it's even more critical that Americans have meaningful access to health care. And so that's what I'm about to do. And again, I'm not initiating any new law, any new aspect of the law. This is going back to what the situation was prior to the President's Executive orders. And the first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to, affordability of, and extent of access to Medicaid is now, in the middle of this COVID crisis. [The President signed an Executive order titled ""Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act"".] And the second order I'm singing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to title 10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights. [The President signed a memorandum on protecting women's health at home and abroad.] I'm sorry you had to stand in the cold before you all came in. Thank you all very much. Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, is health care working as is, or when are you going to put out health care legislation? The President. We've got a lot to do. And the first thing I've got to do is get this COVID package passed. Q. Do you think getting COVID relief passed will require you to break it up into chunks, Mr. President? The President. No one requires me to do anything. Thank you."
"Jan 29, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters Prior to Departure for Bethesda, Maryland","The President. Well, folks, I'm going to have a discussion here with Secretary Yellen and my economic team to discuss the economic consequences of the Congress failing to pass our American Rescue Plan. There is an overwhelming consensus among economists left, right, and center that this is a unique moment in this crisis, and the cost of inaction is high, and it's growing every day. The crisis itself is accelerating. Nine hundred thousand more Americans filed unemployment—for unemployment insurance in this week alone. Thirty million Americans don't have enough food to eat this week. And interest rates are at historic lows, and the return on smart investments in the economy have never been higher. And it's not just me saying this; as I said, it's the consensus among the vast majority of leading economists in the country—as I said, left, right, and center—including advisers to former President Trump and George W. Bush. And so I've been meeting all morning with other folks as well. The notion here is the—we have to act now; it's—there's no time for any delay. And so we can end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year, according to Moody's, a Wall Street firm, and it could take a year longer to return to full employment if we don't act and don't act now. We could see an entire cohort of kids with a lower lifetime earnings because they're deprived of another semester of school. Millions of parents and maybe some of you—millions of parents are—particularly moms—are forced to stay home, reducing the family wages. And if they're a single-wage earner, it's really difficult. And future job prospects that—they have no choice but to stay home and take care of their children. Millions of people are out of work, unemployed. Future millions of—are held back for no good reason other than our failure to act. So the choice couldn't be clearer. We have learned from past crises the risk is not doing too much; the risk is not doing enough. And this is the time to act now. And I've asked Secretary Yellen, who has been leading this effort, to come in, and we're going to go into some detail among ourselves, but I think she has a statement to make as well. Secretary Yellen. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The President. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Secretary Yellen. Well, there is a huge amount of pain in our economy right now, and it was evident in the data released yesterday. Over a million people applied for unemployment insurance last week, and that's far more than in the worst week of the Great Recession. And economists agree that if there's not more help, many more people will lose their small businesses, the roofs over their heads, and the ability to feed their families. And we need to help those people before the virus is brought under control. The President's American Rescue Plan will help millions of people make it to the other side of this pandemic, and it will also make some smart investments to get our economy back on track. I want to emphasize—the President is absolutely right—the price of doing nothing is much higher than the price of doing something and doing something big. We need to act now, and the benefits of acting now and acting big will far outweigh the costs in the long run. Coronavirus Vaccine Development/Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, what do you think of the Johnson and Johnson results? The President. I'm waiting to hear from my team—I'm waiting to hear from the team on the detail of it. I saw the news reported this morning. I haven't had a chance to speak with Dr. Fauci. One point I want to make that the Secretary made—now let's get this straight: It's not only that people will be badly, badly hurt if we don't pass this package, in terms of increased rate of death, in terms of poverty—a whole range of things—but we will also be hurt long term, economically—economically. We need to make this investment so the economy can grow the remainder of this year and next year. The investments now will help the economy grow. It will not, in fact, put—be a—put a drag on the economy, us spending this money. It will do the exact opposite. So thank you all very much."
"Feb 02, 2021",Remarks on Signing Executive Orders on Immigration Reform and an Exchange With Reporters,"Q. Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed? The President's Visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland/Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution  Q. Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed? The President. I'm going out to visit some of the soldiers and sailors that are—been wounded and look at the vaccination procedure. I've been at Walter Reed a lot. I spent almost 6 months there myself as a patient. And in addition to that, as Vice President, every single Christmas, we spent all of Christmas Day at Walter Reed. These kids are amazing. And thank God there's not as many people to visit, so all the people I'm seeing today, who are being treated, or—four of them amputees—are people who, in fact, are retired and—but they're real heroes. And then, we're going to go see the vaccination distribution. So they're—I spent a lot of time at Walter Reed. They're great Americans. They're great people. Nice to see you all. Q. Any progress on your COVID bill? Q. Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation? The President. I'm sorry? Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation? The President. I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass. There's no if, ands, or buts. Thank you. Q. And if it doesn't have Republican support, Mr. President?"
"Feb 04, 2021",Remarks to Staff at the Department of State,"Shooting of Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents in Sunrise, Florida  The President. Well, let me begin by saying, from all three of us—the Vice President, the new Secretary of Homeland Security—that our hearts go out to the families of these FBI special agents and—two of whom were killed and three of whom were injured today in Florida. I was briefed on this tragedy earlier today, and I know the FBI is gathering information about how this happened, what happened. But I can only imagine how these families are feeling today. You know, one of the things, when you are in a combat zone of the military or you're a FBI agent or military or a police officer, every family just—when they put that shield on and go out in the morning—dreads the possibility of a call—receiving that phone call. And my heart aches for the families. I've not had an opportunity, nor will I try today, to contact them. But they put their lives on the line, and it's a hell of a price to pay. And every single day, every single one of these folks get up, and they—by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people who put themselves on the line, and we owe them. Senate Confirmation of Alejandro N. Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland Security  But the purpose of my asking you here today is, I want to congratulate the new Secretary. Secretary Mayorkas is going to take on an easy job—nothing to it: Homeland Security. And going to deal—I'm looking forward to his leadership and working with Congress on a lot of issues, including the immigration bill that has, I think, great support in both Chambers. Immigration Reform/The President's Use of Executive Actions  Today I'm going to sign a few Executive orders to strengthen our immigration system, building on the Executive actions I took on day one to protect DREAMers and to end the Muslim ban and to better manage of our borders. And that's what these three different Executive orders are about. And I want to make it clear—there's a lot of talk, with good reason, about the number of Executive orders that I have signed—I'm not making new law; I'm eliminating bad policy. What I'm doing is taking on the issues that—99 percent of them—that the President—the last President of the United States issued Executive orders I felt were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration. This is about how America is safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly, and humane legal immigration system. And with the first action today, we're going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families—their mothers and fathers at the border—and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who are still in custody and their parents. The second action addresses the root causes of our—migration to our southern border. And the third action—the third order I'm going to be signing—orders a full review of the previous administration's harmful and counterproductive immigration policies, basically across the board. And so, with that, I'm going to sign the first order, which is the reestablishment of an Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families. It removes the stain on our reputation for what these separations caused. [At this point, the President Signed an Executive order titled ""Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.""] That is the first order. The second order I'm signing is: ""Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration and To Manage Migration Throughout the North and Central America and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border."" [The President signed the Executive order.] And the third order I'm signing is: ""Restoring the Faith in Our Legal Immigration System and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans."" [The President signed the Executive order.] As my grandfather would say: By the grace of God and the good will of neighbors, we'll reunite these children and reestablish our reputation as being a haven for people in need. Thank you very, very much. Immigration Reform  Q. Mr. President, what's your message to these families who have been separated? Q. Will you raise the refugee cap, sir, Mr. President? The President. Thank you. Q. When will we see action to back up these reviews, Mr. President? The President. We'll have plenty of time to talk about it."
"Feb 04, 2021",Remarks on United States Foreign Policy at the Department of State,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for welcoming the Vice President and me back to the State Department. It's true, the Secretary and I have worked together a long time. And I know that he has the background and the capacity needed to, quite frankly, lead the State Department at a critical moment. This has been a difficult few years. I've been hanging around as—on the Foreign Relations Committee and—as chairman, and then as Vice President, and now as President, for a long time dealing with State. Those of you who work here, and including the new class of diplomats that we—that are on the screen behind me: You're among the brightest, most involved, best educated group of people America has to offer. And—but I come today to talk to everyone at Main State watching remotely and those who will not be able to see this, but will hear about it. You know, an incredible group of diplomats that I've had a chance to work with—and what we never talk about is, you not only have great intellectual capacity, you have great personal courage. I've been with some of you when we've been shot at. I've been with some of you when we've been in places that you would have—not have any idea you'd want to be when you were going to school of foreign policy and foreign service. They never told you what—that was going to happen. But you're an incredible group of individuals. And I've said many times over the years: Those of you who are stationed overseas and have been stationed overseas, you're America's face. You're what people see and the country you are. They look at you. You are the face of America, and it matters. It matters a great deal how you comport yourself and how you deal with the folks that you're dealing with in that particular country. I find it—many of you among the most—and by the way, I think what we don't do enough: We don't thank your families. We don't thank your families for the sacrifices they make. They make sacrifice—real sacrifices. I don't know how many times I have moved—again, moved to see to it that—your spouses, they give up their careers many times to follow you. Many times, their careers are as consequential or more consequential than yours, but they do it for the country. And they're to be thanked. But the main message that I want to communicate to you all is that whether you're part of the newest class of Foreign Service officers or you've worked for decades in the Civil Service or Foreign Service or you're locally employed staff, you're vital, and the success and strength of our nation depends in no small part on you. Later today I'm going to go up on the eighth floor and send a clear message to the world: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back. You are the center of all that I intend to do. You are the heart of it. We're going to rebuild our alliances. We're going to reengage the world and take on the enormous challenge we face dealing with a pandemic, dealing with global warming, and again, standing up for democracy and human rights around the world. Again, as I said, you're the face of America abroad. And in our administration, you're going to be trusted, and you're going to be empowered—trusted and empowered—to do your job. But I ask each of you to abide by a few core tenets: Integrity in all you do. Let me say it again: Integrity in all you do. Transparency and accountability to rebuild trust in America around the world. Working in the service of the American people, not self-interest. And promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility across the board, because our diplomats, at all levels, should reflect the full diversity of this great country. I know how much we ask of you and your families, and I mean that. I do know. It's been a long time I've been dealing with this building and all of your predecessors. And the sacrifices you make are real and not recognized much by the country as a whole. They don't know all that you do. I also know that you've never let us down. I believe in you. I believe in you. We need you badly. I trust you. And I'm going to have your back—that I promise you—just like you're going to have the backs of the American people. What I always point out to people in the years when I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I'd make sure that my Foreign Relations Committee staff came to my home State and worked on constituent services, which many of them thought was sort of beneath them. ""I'm a foreign policy specialist."" But it's all about who you work for—who I work for, who we work for—and the foreign policy is about promoting the interests of the people of the United States within a rubric and a set of principles that treat everyone with decency. So I promise you I'm going to have your back. I promise you. And I expect you to have the back of the American people. Now, I've got a lot of work to do and a lot of catching up to do, a lot of rebuilding to do. And I can't think of any group of people better capable of doing it, more ready than all of you. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I look forward to working with you, I look forward to seeing you, and I look forward to coming back when this auditorium is filled and no one has to wipe down the podium. [Laughter] So, again, folks, thank you. You are the heart and soul of who we are as a country, and the rest of the world is looking to you to help them understand us and so we can help them as well. So thank you all very much, and may God bless you, and may God keep you all safe when you're abroad. Thank you."
"Feb 05, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With House Democratic Leaders To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"Mr. Secretary, it's great to be here with you. And I've been looking forward a long time to be able to call you ""Mr. Secretary."" Good afternoon, everyone. It's an honor to be back at the State Department under the eyes of the first American chief diplomat, Benjamin Franklin. And by the way, I want you all to know in the press I was the Benjamin Franklin Professor of Presidential Politics at Penn. And I thought they did that because I was as old as he was, but I guess not. Anyway, all kidding aside, it's great to be here and stand alongside our most recent senior diplomat, Secretary Tony Blinken. Mr. Secretary, thank you for welcoming us today. We've worked together for over 20 years. Your diplomatic skills are respected equally by your friends and our competitors around the world. And they know when you speak, you speak for me. And so is the message I want the world to hear today: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy. As I said in my Inaugural Address, we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's. American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy. We must meet the new moment accelerating global challenges—from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation—challenging the will only to be solved by nations working together and in common. We can't do it alone. That must be this—we must start with diplomacy rooted in America's most cherished democratic values: defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person with dignity. That's the grounding wire of our global policy—our global power. That's our inexhaustible source of strength. That's America's abiding advantage. Though many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, even pushed to the brink in the last few weeks, the American people are going to emerge from this moment stronger, more determined, and better equipped to unite the world in fighting to defend democracy, because we have fought for it ourselves. Over the past few days, we've been in close cooperation with our allies and partners to bring together the international community to address the military coup in Burma. I've also been in touch with Leader McConnell to discuss our shared concerns about the situation in Burma, and we are united in our resolve. There can be no doubt: In a democracy, force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election. The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications, and refrain from violence. As I said earlier this week, we will work with our partners to support restoration of democracy and the rule of law, and impose consequences on those responsible. Over the past 2 weeks, I've spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends—Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia—to being [begin]Over the past 2 weeks, I've spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends—Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia—to being [begin]* reforming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscle of democratic alliances that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and, I would argue, abuse. American alliances are our greatest asset, and leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again. By leading with diplomacy, we must also mean engaging our adversaries and our competitors diplomatically, where it's in our interest, and advance the security of the American people. That's why yesterday the United States and Russia agreed to extend the New START Treaty for 5 years to preserve the only remaining treaty between our countries safeguarding nuclear stability. At the same time, I made it clear to President Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions—interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning its citizens—are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia and defend our vital interests and our people. And we will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and coordination with other like-minded partners. The politically motivated jailing of Alexei Navalny and the Russian efforts to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are a matter of deep concern to us and the international community. Mr. Navalny, like all Russian citizens, is entitled to his rights under the Russian constitution. He's been targeted—targeted—for exposing corruption. He should be released immediately and without condition. And we'll also take on directly the challenges posed by our prosperity, security, and democratic values by our most serious competitor, China. We'll confront China's economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance. But we are ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so. We will compete from a position of strength by building back better at home, working with our allies and partners, renewing our role in international institutions, and reclaiming our credibility and moral authority, much of which has been lost. That's why we've moved quickly to begin restoring American engagement internationally and earn back our leadership position, to catalyze global action on shared challenges. On day one, I signed the paperwork to rejoin the Paris climate agreement. We're taking steps led by the example of integrating climate objectives across all of our diplomacy and raise the ambition of our climate targets. That way, we can challenge other nations, other major emitters, up to—to up the ante on their own commitments. I'll be hosting climate leaders—a climate leaders' summit to address the climate crisis on Earth Day of this year. America must lead in the face of this existential threat. And just as with the pandemic, it requires global cooperation. We've also reengaged with the World Health Organization. That way, we can build better global preparedness to counter COVID-19, as well as detect and prevent future pandemics, because there will be more. We've elevated the status of cyber issues within our Government, including appointing the first national—Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology. We're launching an urgent initiative to improve our capability, readiness, and resilience in cyberspace. Today I'm announcing additional steps to course-correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership. To begin, Defense Secretary Austin will be leading a Global Posture Review of our forces so that our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities. It will be coordinated across all elements of our national security, with Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken working in close cooperation. And while this review is taking place, we'll be stopping any planned troop withdrawals from Germany. We're also stepping up our diplomacy to end the war in Yemen, a war which has created a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe. I've asked my Middle East team to ensure our support for the United Nations-led initiative to impose a cease-fire, open humanitarian channels, and restore long-dormant peace talks. This morning Secretary Blinken appointed Tim Lenderking, a career foreign policy officer, as our Special Envoy to the Yemen conflict. And I appreciate his doing this. Tim is a life—has lifelong experience in the region, and he'll work with the U.N. Envoy and all parties of the conflict to push for a diplomatic resolution. And Tim's diplomacy will be bolstered by USI—USAID, working to ensure that humanitarian aid is reaching the Yemeni people who are suffering unendurable devastation. This war has to end. And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales. At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV strikes, and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries. We're going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people. We also face a crisis of more than 80 million displaced people suffering all around the world. The United States moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when I first got here. We shined the light of lamp on—of liberty on oppressed people. We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution. And our example pushed other nations to open wide their doors as well. So today I'm approving an Executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need. It's going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged, but that's precisely what we're going to do. This Executive order will position us to be able to raise the refugee admissions back up to 125,000 persons for the first full fiscal year of the Biden-Harris administration. And I'm directing the State Department to consult with Congress about making a downpayment on that commitment as soon as possible. And to further repair our moral leadership, I'm also issuing a Presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally. You know, we'll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combatting criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. And finally, to successfully reassert our diplomacy and keep Americans safe, prosperous, and free, we must restore the health and morale of our foreign policy institutions. I want the people who work in this building and our Embassies and consulates around the world to know: I value your expertise and I respect you, and I will have your back. This administration is going to empower you to do your jobs, not target or politicize you. We want a rigorous debate that brings all perspectives and makes room for dissent. That's how we'll get the best possible policy outcomes. So, with your help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. That's why my administration has already taken the important step to live our domestic values at home—our democratic values at home. Within hours of taking office, I signed an Executive order overturning the hateful, discriminatory Muslim ban; reversed the ban on transgender individuals serving in our military. And as part of our commitment to truth, transparency, and accountability, we stated on day one—we started on day one with daily briefings of the press from the White House. We've reinstituted regular briefings here at State and at the Pentagon. We believe a free press isn't an adversary; rather, it's essential. A free press is essential to the health of a democracy. We've restored our commitment to science and to create policies grounded in facts and evidence. I suspect Ben Franklin would approve. We've taken steps to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the scourge of White supremacy in our own country. Racial equity will not just be an issue for one department in our administration, it has to be the business of the whole of Government in all our Federal policies and institutions. All this matters to foreign policy, because when we host the Summit of Democracies early in my administration to rally the nations of the world to defend democracy globally, to push back the authoritarianism's advance, we'll be a much more credible partner because of these efforts to shore up our own foundations. There's no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy. Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal. And that's why I immediately put forth the American Rescue Plan to pull us out of this economic crisis. That's why I signed an Executive order strengthening our ""Buy American"" policies last week. And it's also why I'll work with Congress to make far-reaching investments in research and development of transformable—in transformable technologies. These investments are going to create jobs, maintain America's competitive edge globally, and ensure all Americans share in the dividends. If we invest in ourselves and our people, if we fight to ensure that American businesses are positioned to compete and win on the global stage, if the rules of international trade aren't stacked against us, if our workers and intellectual property are protected, then there's no country on Earth—not China or any other country on Earth—that can match us. Investing in our diplomacy isn't something we do just because it's the right thing to do for the world. We do it in order to live in peace, security, and prosperity. We do it because it's in our own naked self-interest. When we strengthen our alliances, we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores. When we invest in economic development of countries, we create new markets for our products and reduce the likelihood of instability, violence, and mass migrations. When we strengthen health systems in far regions of the world, we reduce the risk of future pandemics that can threaten our people and our economy. When we defend equal rights of people the world over—of women and girls, LGBTQ individuals, indigenous communities, and people with disabilities, the people of every ethnic background and religion—we also ensure that those rights are protected for our own children here in America. America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage. I come today to the State Department, an agency as old and as storied as the Nation itself, because diplomacy has always been essential to how American—America writes its own destiny. For the diplomacy of Ben Franklin helped assure the success of our revolution. The vision of the Marshall Plan helped prevent the world from foundering on the wreckage of war. And the passions of Eleanor Roosevelt declared the audacious idea of universal rights that belong to all. The leadership of diplomats of every stripe, doing the daily work of engagement, created the very idea of a free and interconnected world. We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen. And our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again. Thank you all. And may God bless you and protect our troops, our diplomats, and our development experts, and all Americans serving in harm's way. Going this way. Thank you all."
"Feb 05, 2021",Remarks on Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"We're going to be talking about the recovery package, but we saw the jobs report that only 6,000 private sector jobs have been created. And at that rate, it's going to take 10 years before we get to full employment. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. We're going to be in a situation where it'll take a long, long time. And I appreciate you all coming over because—and the urgency with which you're moving—this is about people's lives. This is not just about numbers; this is about people's lives. People are—I don't have to tell any of you, they're really hurting. People are being evicted. Just look at all the number of people who are needing and seeking mental health services now. Suicide is up. People are very—really, really—drug abuse, violence against women. People are really feeling the hole. They don't know how to get out. You've given them a lot of hope—a lot of hope—and with the—as they say in Southern Delaware: the grace of God and the good will of the neighbor, with the crick not rising, we can really begin to do something consequential here. So I want to thank you all. And what I—you know, President—President Obama put me in charge of the Recovery Act, and it was hard as hell to get the votes for it to begin with, and then it was hard as hell to get even the number we got. But one thing we learned is, you know, we can't do too much here; we can do too little. We can do too little and sputter. But again, the end result is, it's not just the macroeconomic impact on the economy and our ability to compete internationally, it's people's lives. Real, live people are hurting, and we can fix it. And we can fix it. And the irony of all ironies is, when we help them, we are also helping our competitive capacity through the remainder of this decade. I mean, it's real. So we've got a chance to do something big here. And I'm—and thank you for last night, yesterday, and what you're going to be doing on this Recovery Act. And I can hardly wait to sit down with Peter DeFazio to work on infrastructure. [Laughter] This is the next big piece. So thank you all for being here, and thank you for coming in. I appreciate it. Q. Mr. President, should schools reopen?"
"Feb 08, 2021","Remarks During a Virtual Tour of the State Farm Stadium Vaccination Site in Glendale, Arizona","Thank you for your patience. We had a very good but long meeting with the chairpersons of the House of Representatives in the Oval, and it went a little longer, but it went very well. Thank you all for being here. I'm accompanied by the Vice President and the Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, and I want to talk today about our plan. And the January jobs numbers came out today. And while we are grateful for everyone who found work and is earning a paycheck, it is very clear, our economy is still in trouble. We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the country last month. Overall, we added 49,000 jobs. And this at a time when we have more than 10 million people out of work, 4 million people have been out of work for 6 months or longer, and 2.5 million women have been driven from the workforce. Fifteen million Americans are behind in their rental payments. Twenty-four million adults and twelve million children literally don't have enough food to eat. These aren't Democrats or Republicans, they're Americans. And they're suffering. And they're suffering not because of anything they did. Through no fault of their own, they're suffering. A once-in-a-century virus has decimated our economy, and it's still wreaking havoc on our economy today. And so much of it is still about the virus. We're still in the teeth of this pandemic. In fact, January was the single deadliest month of the whole pandemic. We lost nearly 100,000 lives. I know some in Congress think we've already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country. Others think that things are getting better and we can afford to sit back and either do a little or do nothing at all. That's not what I see. I see enormous pain this country. A lot of folks out of work. A lot of folks going hungry, staring at the ceiling tonight wondering, ""What am I going to do tomorrow?"" A lot of folks trying to figure out how to keep their jobs and take care of their children. A lot of folks reaching the breaking point. Suicides are up. Mental health needs are increasing. Violence against women and children is increasing. A lot of folks are losing hope. And I believe the American people are looking right now to their Government for help, to do our job, to not to let them down. So I'm going to act, and I'm going to act fast. I'd like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I've met with Republicans. There's some really fine people who want to get something done, but they're just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go. I've told both Republicans and Democrats that's my preference: to work together. But if I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting dragged—bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that's up to the crisis, that's an easy choice. I'm going to help the American people who are hurting now. That's why I'm so grateful to the House and Senate for moving so fast on the American Rescue Plan. Here's what's in that plan: First, it puts $160 billion into our national COVID-19 strategy, which includes more money for manufacturing, distribution, and setting up of vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms. There is simply nothing more important than us getting the resources we need to vaccinate the people in this country as soon, as quickly as possible. So job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines. Vaccines. The second, the American Rescue Plan is going to keep the commitment of $2,000: $600 has already gone out; $1,400 checks to people who need it. This is money directly in people's pockets. They need it. We need to target that money. So folks making $300,000 don't get any windfall. But if you're a two—if you're a family that's a two-wage earner, each of the parents—one making 30 grand and one making 40 or 50—maybe that's a little more than—well, yes, they need the money, and they're going to get it. And here's what I won't do: I'm not cutting the size of the checks. They're going to be $1,400. Period. That's what the American people were promised. And very quickly, here's the rest of my plan: It has money for food and nutrition so that folks don't go hungry. I think our Republican friends are going to support that. It extends unemployment insurance, which is going to run out on March 13 of this year, to the end of September of this year, because there is still going to be—we're still going to have high unemployment. It helps small businesses, thousands of whom have had to go out of business. It has money to help folks pay their health insurance. It has rental assistance to keep people in their homes, rather than being thrown out in the street. It's got money to help us open our schools safely. It has money for childcare, for paid leave. It gets needed resources to State and local governments to prevent layoffs of essential personnel: firefighters, nurses, folks that are schoolteachers, sanitation workers. It raises the minimum wage. It's big, and it's bold. And it's a real answer to the crisis we're in. And it's one more thing. And I want to say it very clearly on this—be very clear on this point: It's better economics. It not only addresses the immediate crisis we're in, it's better for the long-term economic health of our Nation and our competitiveness. My plan creates more jobs, it creates more economic growth, and does more to make us competitive with the rest of the world than any other plan. Don't take my word for it. Just look at what leading economists across the Nation have said—and the world, and across the ocean have said. Wall Street investment firm Moody's says if we pass the American Rescue Plan, it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution has looked at the Rescue—American Rescue Plan—and said the GDP of—will reach prepandemic projections by 2021, meaning we'll have recovered by the end of 2021. And much sooner, by the way, than if we do nothing. Look, just this week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that if we don't take action, it would take until the year 2025 to return to full employment. There's also a growing chorus of top economists—right, center, left—that say we should be less focused on the deficit and more focused on the investments we make and can make now in jobs, keeping families out of poverty, and preventing long-term economic damage to our Nation. The simple truth is, if we make these investments now, with interest rates at historic lows, we'll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy, and our Nation's finances will be in a stronger position as well. And the payoff won't just be in jobs, but in our global competitiveness as well, because we'll be regaining our economic strength faster. So the way I see it: The biggest risk is not going too big, if we go—it's if we go too small. We've been here before. When this Nation hit the Great Recession that Barack and I inherited in 2009, I was asked to lead the effort on the economic Recovery Act to get it passed. It was a big recovery package, roughly $800 billion. I did everything I could to get it passed, including getting three Republicans to change their votes and vote for it. But it wasn't enough. It wasn't quite big enough. It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger. Today, we need an answer that meets the challenge of this crisis, not one that falls short. And that's the issue facing the country right now. What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough. All of a sudden, many of them have rediscovered fiscal restraint and the concern for the deficits. But don't kid yourself: This approach will come with a cost: more pain for more people, for longer than it has to be. Secretary Yellen talks about the scarring effect that comes with prolonged economic pain. We see that scarring effect in economic data. But more important, we can see it in the lives of people living with long-term unemployment, living in hunger, at wits' end over how to keep their jobs and take care of their kids. And then, she talks about the need to alleviate long-term suffering in the economy. We can do that. We don't have to wait until 2025 to get back to full employment, which will be the case if we don't do this. Again, independent analysis from places like Moody's, on Wall Street, the Brookings Institution—the American Rescue Plan could achieve that by the beginning—full employment by the beginning of next year. So, to me, this is what this moment comes down to. Are we going to pass a big enough package to vaccinate people, to get people back to work, to alleviate the suffering in this country this year? That's what I want to do. Or are we going to say to millions of Americans who are out of work, many of whom have been out of work for 6 months or longer, who have been scarred by this economic and public health crisis: ""Don't worry, hang on. Things are going to get better. We're going to go smaller, so it's just going to take us a lot longer""? Like, until 2025. That's the Republican answer right now. I can't in good conscience do that. Too many people in the Nation have already suffered for too long through this pandemic and economic crisis. And telling them we don't have the money to alleviate their suffering, to get to full employment sooner, to vaccinate America after $8 trillion in deficit spending over the past 4 years—much of it having gone to the wealthiest people in the country—is neither true nor necessary. We do have the resources to get to full employment sooner. We do have the tools to reduce a lot of suffering in this country. We just have to choose to use them. So it's time to act. We can reduce suffering in this country. We can put people back to work. We can control—gain control of this virus. That's what the American Rescue Plan does. And that's what I'm determined to do, and that's what I hope we're going to be able to do in the near term. So may God bless you all, may God protect our troops. And I truly believe real help is on the way. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, how could you better target who gets the $1,400 check?"
"Feb 09, 2021",Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Business Leaders on the American Rescue Plan,"White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President. On your second day in office, you announced a comprehensive national strategy to fight the pandemic. Importantly, you called for a whole-of-Government approach. Central to that strategy, you directed your team to activate the full resources of the Federal Government to get more shots in arms. We immediately got to work. First, to increase vaccine supply. Second, to get more vaccinators in the field. And third, to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated. [At this point, Coordinator Zients continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] So now let me introduce you to Dr. Christ, the Director of the Arizona Department of Health Services. Dr. Christ, over to you. Arizona Department of Health Services Director Cara M. Christ. Good afternoon, and we are so honored to have you here at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. I want to take you into the command tent, where we manage the day-to-day operations of the State's only 24/7 State-operated vaccination site. So come on in. [Director Christ continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] And in the next couple of weeks, we will be opening up our third pod down in Pima County, which is Tucson, our second most populous county here in Arizona. I'm happy to take any questions that you may have. The President. Doctor, let me ask you—this is Joe Biden. Let me ask you a question. Were you able to do this—would you be able to do this without Federal help? The reason I ask it is, a lot of States originally said: ""We're fine. We don't need any help. We'll—just get us the vaccine, and we'll be fine."" Talk to me practically about what it took to get it to this stage. Director Christ. So, without the Federal funding and without the Federal partnership, this would be a huge logistical lift. And so, the fact that we've got such great partnership with our Federal partners—whether it's FEMA, whether it's HHS—that has been just—that's been the crux. And so, without that funding and the vaccine and the vaccinators that have come out here, along with all of the logistical support that we've gotten—it's a huge lift to put something like this together. The President. Why did you decide on this site for the drive-thru? Director Christ. So that is a great question, Mr. President. I—one of the things is our partnership with the Arizona Cardinals. So Michael Bidwill and the Cardinals have been strong partners throughout the COVID response. We actually had a testing site, in partnership here at—with ASU, Arizona State University, as well as the Arizona Cardinals. So we had some of the infrastructure and the plans in place to then build into a vaccination site. But it's also got great freeway access. Everybody knows where it is. We can do freeway signs so that people can easily navigate into the parking lot. And with the NFL season in Arizona being over, it was the perfect partnership. The President. I got a call during the Super Bowl from the commissioner of football, and—offering us, the Federal Government, the 30 major stadiums. So I think they're going to be coming to you to look at how you did it because you're doing such a great job. One last question. Do you—I was pleased and a little surprised to hear that if a caretaker drove somebody, or if I assume a family member drove someone who qualifies to get the shot, they would also qualify as well. Is that correct? Director Christ. Yes, it's a clinical decision made onsite, at the time. It depends on our vaccine supply and the capacity that we have at the site to be able to register that additional person. But we really try. We know that people are in constant contact with family members and loved ones. And the more we can do to surround them with vaccinated people, like their caretaker, it just keeps people safer. The President. Well, one of the things you may recall—the Vice President and I announced about 15 days ago that we were going to try and get 100 million shots in 100 days into the people's arms. We found out we didn't quite have the supply of vaccine we thought initially. We're all set now, but we're exceeding that number. And so because of folks like you, who are dedicated—and I just want to—before I turn it over to the Vice President—she may have some questions—I just want to thank you for your dedication. You're saving people's lives, short term and long term. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm looking forward to meeting you one day. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Hi, Doctor. I join the President: thank you, thank you. This is an incredible model. How are you reaching out to your hardest hit communities and those who may have a difficult time with transportation or just, proportionally, are some of the hardest hit but maybe not receiving the vaccine at the greatest numbers? What kind of outreach are you doing? The President. We lost you, Doc. Vice President Harris. Uh-oh. You're muted. Director Christ. Am I good right now? The President. You're good. [Laughter] Director Christ. Okay, perfect. Okay, sorry—the technical. So that is a really great question, Madam Vice President, and something that, here in Arizona, we feel strongly about. So this is just one portion of our State vaccination plan. So we are looking to partner with community leaders to put community-based pods in some of those hard-to-reach and targeted ZIP Codes. We have contracted with communications groups that specialize in reaching our Hispanic/Latino or our hard-to-reach populations to do intense communication about the importance of vaccine. We're also working with our State's Medicaid program to ensure that we've got nonmedical transport available that they can use if they want to come out here to one of these sites or any other sites. And we're also taking advantage of the CDC's retail pharmacy partnership to make sure that we're getting those vaccines into pharmacies in hard-to-hit areas, as well as our community health centers. And so that's just a little bit about the plan, but we definitely are trying to target those populations because we know how at risk they are. Vice President Harris. And my other question is the: What's the proportion—do you have a sense—of the folks that are getting the first vaccine versus the second vaccine? Director Christ. So we here are very surprised at how willing people are to get that second-dose vaccine. So we've been—that was one of our lessons learned here at State Farm Stadium: We register people for their second dose before they actually leave this site. And prior, we had been just telling them we would e-mail them. That has been great. We have a high demand for second dose. And we actually take people who are looking to get their second dose, but can't find it somewhere else, here at State Farm as walk-ins. Vice President Harris. That's great. Thank you for your work. And to your whole team, thank them. The President. Doing a great job, Doc. Director Christ. All right, well, now I am going to hand it over to Brittney, who is our lead clinical supervisor. She is out at the vaccination tents, and I know she's looking forward to talking with you. The President. Thank you. Arizona State University Vaccination Pod Head Charge Nurse Brittney Hayes. Hi, I'm Brittney Hayes. I'm with Arizona State University. I'm the head charge nurse here at the vaccination pod at State Farm Stadium. [Ms. Hayes continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] And then, as far as some of the successes, I mean, we're vaccinating one vaccine per 10 seconds, so I feel like that is very impressive, and we are giving people hope—giving volunteers and staff purpose. And then, feeling united. This has been a long year, and I'm just thrilled that we can give that unity back. Back to you. The President. We're really proud of you. Ms. Hayes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. The President. No, I really mean it. Tell me about the number of volunteers. Are these pure volunteers? Do they get per diem or are they pure volunteers? Ms. Hayes. [Inaudible]—for our volunteers. I'm not exactly sure everything that goes into that process, but over 50 percent of probably what is on my vaccination pods here are volunteers. All of our datafication people are volunteers. The President. And when someone comes through in a vehicle, do they have to demonstrate proof of eligibility or have they also been cleared before they get to that tent? Ms. Hayes. That's what I'm for—the charge nurse. I have dedicated that to them to make that decision. If they have allergies or something along those lines—immunocompromised, if they had COVID and had the convalescent plasma—that's my job to dig a little deeper than what the assessment of the vaccinator is and to really see that they are eligible, because I want to give the vaccine to everybody possible. The President. Now, in Arizona, what is the age eligibility for coming through that tent? Ms. Hayes. So we are—since we are doing the Pfizer vaccine, it is 16 and over, but the 16 and over have to be—the appointment needs to be made online. If they are a walk-in, it does have to be 18 or older due to them just being minors. The President. Right. And what do you hear from the folks coming through that get the vaccine—that actually get the shot in their arm? What are the kind of things you most often hear from them or your volunteers hear? Ms. Hayes. They're amazed—yes, no. I'm sorry. They're amazed by the process, the smoothness. I hear that a lot. I hear a lot of other touching stories, you know, that people have gone through due to COVID. And you know, they're here, and really we're instilling hope. A ""dose of hope"" is what I've been calling it. I've heard a—yes, but the smoothness of the process is what I hear most. The President. Last question I have: How can we best support you and other frontline workers? Ms. Hayes. That's a great question. So the collaboration that I have with FEMA, DEMA, all of the other State—everybody that I've partnered with here, I get nothing but the utmost support, and it's been amazing to collaborate with everybody. They check in. If I need something, it's done. They know that I'm trying to do everything to make this safe and efficient. So, support, yes. The President. Well, are you a freshman at the university? [Laughter] Ms. Hayes. No. No. [Laughter] The President. I'm teasing. [Laughter] Ms. Hayes. No. The President. You look like a freshman. Ms. Hayes. Why, thank you. The President. Well, no, thank you for what you're doing. It really matters. As I said to the Doc last—a few moments ago, Dr. Christ, we committed when we got in that—we were short on vaccines and short on organization, and—when we got sworn in. And we committed to do 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days, and we're exceeding that. With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and help of people like you, we're going to end up doing more than that. So thank you for what you're doing. You're saving people's lives. Ms. Hayes. Absolutely. And I'm more than happy to be here. The President. I'm going to turn it over to the Vice President. She's got the tough questions. Ms. Hayes. Oh, okay. Vice President Harris. [Laughter] Hi, Brittney. Ms. Hayes. Hi. Vice President Harris. Hi, thank you for everything you're doing. You are a role model of how this kind of approach can work, and thank you for that, because it's not easy being a role model and being one of the first. But that being said, you're a leader, really, in the country around what you're experiencing right now and how that can help others that start to pop up. And we intend on doing this around—in many places around the country. So what would your advice be to others who are setting up an operation like yours? What did you learn worked and what didn't work? So we can learn from whatever you have experienced. Ms. Hayes. I think—like I said, one of my biggest challenges was staffing and just how to incorporate—I feel like I have incorporated things that I had worked, you know, as a bedside nurse: getting a huddle together, getting a process together. I have made a actual ""charge binder""—is what I have been calling it—that has everything my charge nurse would need to know to be able to run the site efficiently. And then, I'm always available for questions and support. I think that's the biggest thing—is to let them know they are not alone in making decisions and— being able to keep our patrons and staff safe. Vice President Harris. That's great. Thank you so very much. You're doing it, and you're making a huge difference, and you are inspiring all of us. So thank you for everything you are doing. It really does matter in such a big way. Thank you. Ms. Hayes. Thank you. The President. And you're a—are you a nurse? Ms. Hayes. I am. I'm a nurse. I'm an RN. I've been an RN for about 9 years now. The President. Well, I know, having been a significant consumer of health care, I can tell—I know the Vice President knows this, when I say it: Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. If there's any angels in Heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. And that's not an exaggeration. Vice President Harris. That's right. The President. That's the God's truth. Thank you for all you do. Ms. Hayes. Thank you very much. The President. Thank you. Okay. Keep it going. Ms. Hayes. I'm going to turn it back to Dr. Christ. The President. Okay. Vice President Harris. Okay. Director Christ. Thank you so much, Brittney. She is one of our most dedicated nurses out here, but we have such a great team behind us. You can see—this is the site behind us. It takes about 30 minutes to go, from the time you pull on to the time you leave. But with me, I have our Acting Regional Administrator for FEMA, Tammy Littrell, and the head of the Arizona National Guard, Major General Michael McGuire. So I'm going to turn it over to Tammy. Federal Emergency Management Agency Acting Regional Administrator Tammy L. Littrell. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Madam Vice President. It is such an honor today to be a part of this State's initiative to stand up what I call one of the most efficient and effective vaccination centers. To just be able to see the—all levels of Government and the private sector, as well as all the volunteers, come together to help the American people get vaccinated is going to help us, as a FEMA team, be able to go back to California and be able to set up our vaccination centers in Oakland and in Los Angeles next week. [Acting Regional Administrator Littrell continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] With that, sir, I believe another—I'd like to just take a moment just to share two examples that we have heard of, and that is the Navajo Nation. The President. Yes. Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. So as we support the Navajo Nation, we are going to stand up four vaccination centers. This will help increase their access to the vaccination, as well as take the burden off of their Tribal members from having to drive in these austere winter conditions that they are experiencing right now. [Acting Regional Administrator Littrell continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] So with that, I also want to just close with thanking you, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, for your leadership in leading the way. The President. Well, thank you. Vice President Harris. Thank you. Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. I will now turn it back over to you, Mr. President. The President. Well, first of all, thank you. You're doing one heck of a job. One of the things that when we started to try to figure out what we were going to do when we came into office, because there wasn't much of a transition—we didn't have—we weren't given a lot of information. And some of the information we had turned out not to be accurate in terms of vaccine supplies. And we met virtually with all the Governors, and the Governors basically said, ""Just send us the vaccine; we'll take care of it."" And the fact is, I think they and everyone else vastly underestimated the logistical needs that go with having the vaccine—assuming you have enough vaccine. And so one of the first things we did was we called in FEMA and also contacted every Governor, General, and told them that we'll pay for the National Guard, it won't be their expense, because you guys are—and women are badly needed. And in addition to that, the Defense Department has allocated over 1,000—they're going to go up to 100,000 people who are going to be helping along—10,000 people who are helping along the way. So I just want to thank you for the coordination. I mentioned this to Dr. Christ a little earlier, but the coordination is really—it really matters. And we've got people who know what they're doing, starting with the Doc and you too, both with FEMA and—well, the National Guard. That that's your business. You know how to get it done. And so—and you are really doing it. I just think what you put together is amazing. Our hope is that we're going to be able to not only get—keep the commitment to get 100 million shots in people's arms by the first 100 days—I think we'll get—we'll exceed that considerably—but also to—we've now been able to go out and talk with—personally with the vaccine manufacturers. They've upped significantly the commitments to the amount of vaccine they'll produce and when it will be produced. And so I—and things are beginning to click. People are beginning to feel that they can find their way to get the vaccine. And lastly, one of the most important things for us—and you mentioned what's happening on the Navajo Tribe; I've met with the leaders—is that it really—it really does matter that we have access to the people who are most in need, but are—and most affected by the COVID crisis, dying at faster rates, getting sick at faster rates, and—but not being available, not being able to get into the mix. And so equity is a big thing, and I want to thank you all three of you—for engaging in that. But I don't—we didn't hear from—I'm going to turn this over to the Vice President. But, General, I hope we're going to hear from you as well after the Vice President says something to—whatever she wants to say. Okay? Vice President Harris. Thank you, Mr. President. Just a quick question, Ms. Littrell. Can you talk a little bit about what you think will be the challenges in terms of the mobile units and what will be the strengths of that? Because, again, we're going to be watching these first rollouts as a model for what we do in other places. So, from the ground, what do you see as being the challenges and the strengths of that operation around mobile units? Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. Sure. I would start with the strengths only because I've talked to our CDC partners and the public health professionals, where, at first, I thought we were going to have—you know, be using or depending upon our—just our mobile command vehicles out of our detachment—our MERS detachments out of FEMA, which they are still going to assist and help us because they have the means to technology where we can take on the road and then also be able to allow those who need to enroll, be able to do so at ease. But after talking with CDC and the public health professionals, they educated us and let us know that there are mobile operations within the public health sector that are really good at mobile operations. So we're going to maximize as much as we possibly can and not just lean on our own understanding, our own FEMA resources in order to go mobile. So a lot to learn still, but we're staying optimistic that we're going to once again be able to come together and be able to reach those who need us the most. Vice President Harris. Thank you. Thank you. Acting Regional Administrator Littrell. Thank you, ma'am. The President. General, how you doing? Arizona National Guard Adjutant General Major General Michael T. McGuire, USAF. I'm doing good, Mr. President. How are you today? The President. Better for seeing you, man. [Laughter] Adjutant General McGuire. Well, we appreciate the partnership with FEMA and all the DOD, all our Federal partners who have been out here—IHS, HHS—all the things that have happened. [Adjutant General McGuire continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] So thanks for all you're doing there on the Federal team, and I look forward to continue to replicate this around Arizona, and hope plagiarism is the highest form of flattery. That's what we say. So if everyone wants to copy what Arizona is doing, we think we've got it figured it out here. So thanks, sir. The President. Well, you sure have it figured out at that spot, General. And thank you for all you've done, and thank you for what you do. And you probably have been deployed with your group several times in the last 10 years, so thank you for that as well. Adjutant General McGuire. Yes, sir. The President. Madam Vice President. Vice President Harris. Thank you, General. Thank you very much for all—and please thank all your troops for us. Thank you. Adjutant General McGuire. Yes, ma'am. The President. And, Dr. Christ, thank you for the tour and to meet some of your frontline workers. I—you know, I'm sorry that we weren't in a position that the Governor could be with us today, but he's been very, very cooperative and very helpful. He's stepped up. And this is the kind of partnership between the Federal and State Governments that I think—and the private sector—to help us vaccinate more people more quickly, and to get ahead of this virus instead of behind it. And we're optimistic that we have enough—we'll have enough of the vaccine in the pipeline to be able to provide shots for over—including double shots for over 300 million people before we get through the summer. At least that's our hope. And it includes getting vaccines to the pharmacies—as you pointed out to me earlier, Doc—and vaccination centers like the one you have there. And we're going to need—if we need more vaccinators, we'll send them, we'll find them for you. So let us know. And again, I want to thank you very, very much for your leadership. I look forward to—I wish we were in a situation—it sounds—it's counterintuitive—because of COVID, we can't see you—come and see you, which we'd ordinarily be doing—getting on a plane and coming out and looking firsthand. But you know, the fact is that you're the reason why we're going to beat this disease. And we will beat it. You know, big or small, we're going to do whatever it takes to reach and surpass our goal of over 100 million in 100 days. And there's a lot to do, and it's going to take time. We're going to face some setbacks along the way, including the complication of the strains that we're seeing from South Africa and other places. But I know we can do it. We've never failed as a country when we've done things together. Never, ever, ever, ever fail when united. And you guys are the example of unity. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Madam Vice President. Vice President Harris. Well, thank you all. As one of the first of this example of the partnership between the Federal Government, State, local, you all really are a model. And there are folks around the country who are going to benefit from the work you all are doing on the ground in Arizona—people who may not know your name, people you may not meet, but are going to be forever benefited because of your around-the-clock, hard work. You are taking this on as a personal mission on behalf of folks who need your help, and you are there to do what's necessary. So thank you. Together with Governor Ducey, Senator Sinema, and Kelly, and so many others, I think we're showing how when we are unified, we can get a lot of good work done. So thank you all. The President. There's no such thing as a red State or a blue State when it comes to COVID. There's no such thing as Democrat or Republican—— Vice President Harris. That's right. The President. ——when it comes to COVID. When we stand united, there's not a damn thing we've been unable to do. And you're the—you're a perfect example of that. So thanks again. Stay safe. Stay safe. And thank you. Vice President Harris. Thank you."
"Feb 10, 2021",Remarks on the Situation in Burma,"The President. Hello, folks. Thanks for coming in. I've invited in some of the leading businesspeople in America to come in and talk about the state of the economy, our recovery package. We're going to talk a little bit, God willing, about infrastructure down the road, and also about the—a little about the minimum wage. But I want to thank each of them for being here and participating. I think they're—as I've said before—you've heard me say it to labor groups and others as well—that the American people are hurting. There's a lot of people who are in real, real trouble. A lot of people going to bed at night, staring at the ceiling wondering whether they're going to be in that apartment the next day or if they're going to be evicted or if they're going to keep their mortgage payment up, if they're going to have any health insurance. We've got millions of people unemployed. As Secretary Yellen has pointed out, we have a scarring effect that may be going on and can get worse. We have kids not in school. There's a whole range of issues, but I think they're all soluble. I think they're all within our capacity. As you know, I've met for a long time with my Republican colleagues. I've been exchanging correspondence with them and telephone calls, as well, to see if there's any way we can follow up beyond where we are, and meeting with the Members of the House and the Senate as well. And I think we're in a position to think big and move big and to move in a direction that can not only get the economy back on its feet, but we have to get people well before we get people on their feet. And we've focused a lot of the attention on making sure that we deal with the coronavirus, get it under control. As you know, you've been through it all in detail with me on what we're doing on the coronavirus and the funding mechanisms that exist within this package, as well as we have to deal at the same time with the employment. We have to deal at the same time with business and growth of the economy. We can't let one wait. We can't get everybody well and then move on the economy. We have to move quickly on both. And I'm anxious to hear what these business leaders have to say about how they think I'm approaching this issue, we're approaching this issue, and to see if we can find some common ground. I know I've found some common ground with some of my Republican friends and a lot of the Democrats as well, so I'm optimistic. So thank you all for coming in. I appreciate it. Senate Impeachment Trial of Former President Donald J. Trump/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Mr. President, just briefly on impeachment. Q. Will you watch President Trump's trial? Q. Just briefly on impeachment, do you mind? Q. Will you watch the trial? Are you going to watch the trial? The President. I am not. Look, I told you before: I have a job. My job is to keep people—we've already lost over 450,000 people. We're going to lose a whole lot more if we don't act and act decisively and quickly. A lot of people, as I said, are going—a lot of children are going to be hungry. A lot of families are food insecure. They're in trouble. That's my job. The Senate has their job; they're about to begin it. I'm sure they're going to conduct themselves well. And that's all I'm going to have to say about impeachment. So thank you very, very much. Appreciate it. Proposed Income Cap for Economic Stimulus Relief  Q. Do you want to comment on the Democrats' proposal last night, President Biden, about the $75,000 cap? Do you agree with that? The President. Yes. Q. Okay. The President. Thanks, everybody."
"Feb 10, 2021","Remarks to Department of Defense Personnel at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia","Thank you for being here on short notice. I'm going to be very brief, but I—because the Vice President and I are heading over the Pentagon for an extensive briefing and to make some comments, as we did at the State Department. So I'm going to be going from here to there, and you'll get me there as well. I want to say good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to give you an update on the latest regarding our response to the military coup in Burma. As you know, the assault on Burma's transition to democracy remains an issue of deep bipartisan concern. We've consulted at length, for example, with Senator McConnell, who's had a very keen interest in this, and his team. And we welcome their helpful insights. We've also been in close contact with our allies and partners around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, driving vigorous diplomatic outreach to help coordinate an international response to what happened. A strong and unified message emerging from the United States has been essential, in our view, to encouraging other countries to join us in pressing for an immediate return to democracy. Last week, the United States helped bring together the U.N. Security Council, which issued a strong statement in support of Burmese democracy. And this week, we will use our renewed engagement on the Human Rights Council to strengthen the world's commitment to human rights in Burma. Today I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the democratic political leaders and activists and—that they're now detaining, including Aung San Suu Kyi. And she is—and also Win Myint, the President. The military must relinquish the power it seized and demonstrate respect for the will of the people of Burma as expressed in their November 8 election. So today I'm announcing a series of actions that are—we're taking to begin imposing consequences on the leaders of the coup. The U.S. Government is taking steps to prevent the generals from improperly having access to the $1 billion in Burmese Government funds held in the United States. And today I've approved a new Executive order—— [At this point, the President coughed.] ——excuse me—a new Executive order enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests, as well as close family members. We will identify a first round of targets this week. And we're also going to impose strong exports controls. And we're freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese Government, while maintaining our support for health care, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly. And finally, as protests grow, violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable, and we're going to keep calling it out. The people of Burma are making their voices heard. And the world is watching. We'll be ready to impose additional measures, and we'll continue to work with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in these efforts. So I thank you all. I wanted to have that statement before I got in the vehicle to go out to the Pentagon. And I'm sure I'll see some of you at the Pentagon. Thanks for coming over on such short notice. Thank you."
"Feb 11, 2021",Remarks Prior to Meeting With Senators on Infrastructure and an Exchange With Reporters,"Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you. And good afternoon to everyone. I want to thank Secretary Austin for welcoming the Vice President and me to the Pentagon today. It's good to be back. Before I begin, I have some welcome news that the Saudi Government has released a prominent human rights activist, Loujain al-Hathloul—loul, excuse me, L-O-U-L—from prison. She's a powerful advocate women's rights, and releasing her was the right thing to do. It's been a busy day. Earlier, I announced steps we've taken to impose costs on those responsible for the military coup in Burma. And I've just concluded a briefing with the civilian and military leadership where I laid out my national security priorities. And I want to share the message directly with the Department of Defense staff all around the world. Because each of you—each of you—whether you're newly enlisted, a career officer, a noncommissioned officer, or a civilian policy expert, you're essential to how we project our strength around the world, defend America's interests, and advance American leadership in the world. So often, our Armed Forces and the Department of Defense staff are how the rest of the world encounters America. And you all know as well as anyone that our country is safer and stronger when we lead not just with the example of our power, but with the power of our example. As your Commander in Chief, I will never hesitate to use force to defend the vital interests of the American people and our allies around the world when necessary. The central, indispensable mission of the Department of Defense is to deter aggression from our enemies and, if required, to fight and win wars to keep America safe. But I believe force should be a tool of last resort, not first. I understand the full weight of what it means to ask young, proud Americans to stand in the breach. As was referenced by the Secretary, my son Beau served in Iraq for a year. I'm the first President in 40 years, I'm told, who had a son or daughter who served in a war zone. So I know what it's like. Being Commander in Chief is an enormous responsibility and one that I will never take lightly or easily. I will work with Secretary Austin and leaders around the world to bring a responsible end to wars that have dragged on for far too long, while continuing to ensure that terrorist threats cannot endanger the security of the American people. I also know that you are essential to the work of our diplomacy, not only as the ultimate guarantor of our security, but as diplomats yourselves. I got to know Secretary Austin when he was serving as commander of U.S. Forces in Iraq. It wasn't just his excellent military leadership, the many times I met him there, and his strategy; he was a consummate diplomat as well. He worked closely with our Ambassador to build relationships with both civilian and military leaders of our coalition partners. Because we are better able to project our power when we're amplifying our strength through our alliances, it was so important. There is no aspect of our agenda of the 21st-century leadership where the women and men of the Defense Department do not have a role: whether it's helping curb the pandemic here at home and around the world; or addressing the real threats of climate change that already is costing us billions in impacts on our bases, on our national security; or being part of an ongoing fight for racial justice. You are essential to how we must rethink and reprioritize our security to meet the challenges of this century, not the last. We need to take on the dangers and opportunities of emerging technologies, enhance our capabilities in cyberspace, ensure that we are positioned to lead in a new era of competition, from deep sea to outer space. And we need to meet the growing challenges posed by China to keep the peace and defend our interests in the Indo-Pacific and globally. Today I was briefed on a new DOD-wide China Task Force that Secretary Austin is standing up to look at our strategy and operational concepts, technology, and force posture, and so much more. The Task Force will work quickly, drawing on civilian and military experts across the Department, to provide, within the next few months, recommendations to Senator [Secretary]* Austin on key priorities and decision points so that we can chart a strong path forward on China-related matters. It will require a whole-of-Government effort, bipartisan cooperation in Congress, and strong alliances and partnerships. That's how we'll meet the China challenge and ensure the American people win the competition of the future. You know, to the incredible individuals who serve in our Armed Forces: You are unquestionably part of the finest fighting force in the history of the world. You're warriors. The work you do each and every day is vital to ensuring the American people—your families, friends, and loved ones—are able to live in peace and security and growing prosperity. And for those of you who raise your hands and sign up to wear the uniform of the United States: We owe you an incredible debt. I've said for many years, less than 1 percent of Americans do what you do: put yourself on the line for the rest of the 99 percent of the Americans you represent. The 99 percent of us owe you. We owe it to you to keep the faith with our sacred obligation to properly prepare and equip you when we send you into harm's way and to care for you and your families, both while you are deployed and after you return home. You're incredible heroes and incredible patriots. I will never, ever dishonest you—dishonor you. I will never disrespect you. I will never politicize the work you do. That goes for our civilian professionals as well as the career military. As I've said, this is personal for me. The Biden family is a military family. We learned firsthand some of what your loved ones experienced when Beau was deployed to Iraq for a year with his unit in the Delaware National Guard. We dealt with the stress of his absence and the daily joys—from the daily joys of life. And we worried constantly about his safe return. We felt overwhelming pride in his courage and his patriotism. You are all the best our country has to offer. You live by a creed of selfless sacrifice. And for many of you, the journey to service has not been easy. February is Black History Month, as the Vice President pointed out. Before we leave today, Vice President Harris and I are going to visit the hall honoring the long history of Black Americans fighting for this country, even when their contributions were not always recognized or honored appropriately. But those contributions have nevertheless helped push our country toward greater equality. From the bravery of the free and enslaved descendants of Africans who fought with the colonial forces in our revolution; to the Black regiments that joined to fight for the Union and for their own freedom in the Civil War; to the Buffalo soldiers, including Henry O. Flipper, the first African American graduate of West Point; and Cathay Williams, the first African American woman—Cathay—who enlisted in the United States Army. Imagine the incredible love it must have taken for the proud Tuskegee Airmen to fly more than 15,000 sorties in battle, when their own freedom was not fully realized in their own country. Imagine the determination of Roscoe Robinson, who started at West Point 1 year before Harry Truman issued the order to officially desegregate the Armed Forces, and who rose to become the first African American four-star general. Imagine the bravery of the 22 African Americans awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in the Vietnam war while struggling for civil rights at home was continuing. It's all part of a long history of barrier-breaking service. Right now more than 40 percent of our Active Duty forces are people of color. And it's long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our force is reflected at every level of this Department, including our Secretary of Defense. This organization thrives and succeeds because of our people. So the final point I'd like to make today is to give you my personal commitment that this administration—from myself and the Vice President Harris to Secretary Austin on down—is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect. That's why we moved so quickly to overturn the discriminatory ban on transgender service, and why General Austin's first memo was a directive to take sexual assault in the military seriously. Every single person, no matter their gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or religious background, deserves to feel safe in the ranks and to have their contributions valued. It's on all of us to stand up, to speak out when you see someone being abused. This is an organization that's defined American—excuse me, defeated American enemies on land, sea, and air and been defined by the way we treat others. So I know this is not beyond us, not if each of us makes this a priority as well. So thank you for welcoming us, Secretary Austin. It's good to be back in the Pentagon. I wish I could meet more of you in person today, but I look forward to spending more time with you in all the places you serve around the world. I know this is the honor of my lifetime. The honor of my lifetime is to serve as your Commander in Chief. Thank you for what you do for this country. May God bless you and protect you, and may God protect our troops deployed around the world, every single one of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"Feb 11, 2021","Remarks During a Laboratory Tour at the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center and an Exchange With Reporters in Bethesda, Maryland","The President. Folks, thanks for coming in. I'm going to be very brief. We're going to get to it. We want to talk about infrastructure, and this committee is central to everything that's going to happen. I've been around long enough—and Tom and Jim and all of us—that—it used to be that infrastructure wasn't a Democrat or Republican issue. There are not many Republican or Democratic roads and bridges and so on. So we're going to talk about infrastructure. And hear—I want to hear what's on the minds of my colleagues here, and we're going to see what we can put together. There's a number of things that are out there that the American people are looking at us to step up. Again, it's not—I really, honest to God, never have thought of the—of infrastructure as being a partisan issue. And it's about—I mean, a lot of bridges in West Virginia—— Senator Shelley Moore Capito. That's right. The President. ——a lot of dangerous spots along Route 9, in terms of Cancer Alley. A lot of places where we're having problems all across the country. Senator Thomas R. Carper. The highest point of land in Delaware is a bridge, just for the record. [Laughter] The President. Well, that's true. That's true. And it's named after Bill Roth. Sen. Carper. My first bill. The President. That's right. And I'll tell you what—and Tom climbs up all the time. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, there's a lot we have to do. And I could think of no better group of people to start off with to try to see if we can come to some kind of generic consensus about how to begin. They have a lot of jurisdiction over a significant portion of infrastructure. Last night I was on the phone for 2 straight hours with Xi Jinping. And you all know as well as I do, these folks—and it was a good conversation. I know him well. We spent a lot of time together over the years I was Vice President. And—but you know, they're going to—if we don't get moving, they're going to eat our lunch. They have major, major new initiatives on rail. And they already have rail that goes 225 miles an hour with ease. They're working very hard to do what I think we're going to have to do. And I think the automobile industry is already there, and so is labor. They're going to—they're working very hard to try to move in a position where they end up being the source of a—of a new way in which to power automobiles, which would—they're going to invest a lot of money. They're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment, and a whole range of other things. So we just have to step up. And so what I'd like to—I'm going to talk to these folks about, which is—they're the key committee—is how we begin this. I've laid out what I think I have to do—we should be doing. And they have a plan, as well, within their jurisdiction. But they're also very, very competent Senators who know a lot more than beyond their jurisdiction about the things they need. So I'm looking for a wholesome conversation or a fulsome conversation. So thank you all for coming in. Q. Mr. President, did you have any access to the video—[inaudible]? The President. I didn't—I'm sorry, what did you say? Senate Impeachment Trial of Former President Donald J. Trump  Q. Did you see the video yesterday during the impeachment trial? And what was your reaction, Mr. President? The President. I told you, what I'm focused on—my job is to deal with the promises I made. And we all know we have to move on. Today it's about jobs and infrastructure. I, like other Americans, watched the news. I didn't watch any of the hearing live because I was going straight through, last night, till a little after nine. But I watched some this morning. I think the Senate has a very important job to complete. And I think—my guess is some minds may have been changed, but who—I don't know. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Feb 11, 2021","Remarks to National Institutes of Health Staff in Bethesda, Maryland","[The President's remarks were joined in progress.] The President. Well, we're in a position now where we're just—in talking with Jeff—we've been pushing really, really hard with the manufacturing to significantly increase in the timeframe. Jeff, when will it be by? By June, we'll have—how much will we have? White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeffrey D. Zients. We'll have 400 million does by June, which is enough to vaccinate 200 million Americans. And then, you ordered another 200 million doses—— The President. Yes. Coordinator Zients. ——to be delivered this summer. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. That's the best way to stop the mutations. The President. No, I realize that. And one of the things that—you know, it's amazing how quickly things change in terms of people's perceptions, mine included. I know just a little tiny bit about this because I worked with that guy on cancer issues for a long, long while—[inaudible]—started with the Cancer Institute. Anyway. But what I didn't realize was just how much of the vaccine we're going to have to actually get produced. And it's one thing to have the vaccine; it's another thing to have vaccinators to put it into people's arms. And it's really turned out to be a gigantic logistical issue for us. And I can say—I don't mean it as a criticism, just an observation—when we—we've been in office now 3 years—no, 3 weeks. [Laughter] National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins. It just feels like 3 years. [Laughter] The President. Just feels like 3 years. But what happened is that we were led to—if you ever hear anybody talking about transitions between Presidents, it's really important, because we didn't have any access to the transition. And you know, Doc; we talked about it. And so we thought, and we were led to believe, there was a lot more vaccine available than there was. And when I said ""in the first 100 days,"" I guaranteed—I promised that we would get 100 million shots in people's arms, everybody said, ""No, that's—you can't do that."" It's amazing—now I'm getting, ""Why can't you get more?"" Now we're getting a lot more, as we said, on average, but it could be significantly more. But to get to the place where—and these guys legitimately always ask me—is: ""When will we have enough vaccine to have that 300-plus million people?"" And even though we've increased by close to 600 million—promises of the vaccine—we're going to be in a position where it's going to be—it is not going to be by the end of the summer. [Laughter] And so all the Americans who are looking for it—and that's why I keep listening to you talking about when we could theoretically reach enough of a saturation of access that we slow down the spread. And so—but this is the—it's an amazing—and by the way, every department is jumping in. The Defense Department over there, they jumped right in like they did with dealing with Ebola before, in Africa. They're probably going to have, literally, over a hundred thousand—I mean, excuse me, 10,000 vaccinators. They're picking people up all over; people are coming out of retirement and stepping up. Coronavirus Containment Efforts  Q. Mr. President, how worried are you about the variants? How worried are you about the variants? The President. Well, we talked about the variants, and I'll—rather than Joe Biden, the lawyer, explain the variants—I think I understand it—but I think it's important that, Doc, you talk about the variants and what we're anticipating and what we think the situation is going to be. Director Fauci. The 117—that's the U.K. variant that we feel the modelers are going to tell us is going to be dominant by the end of March—the vaccines that we have now look pretty good against being able to prevent infection and certain disease. The South African variant is a little bit more problematic. It diminishes the capability of the vaccines to induce the virus's—the antibodies that would suppress it. But it doesn't completely eliminate it, and we know that from studies with other vaccines in South Africa, where it went down to maybe 50 percent efficacy. But it was very good in preventing severe disease. In fact, there were no hospitalizations or deaths. Bottom line is: We take it seriously. We're following it. And if necessary, we're able to make boosts that reflect the variants in question. Presidential Transition/Coronavirus Vaccine Supply and Deployment  Q. Are you upset with the state of the rollout before you got here, Mr. President? The President. No, I'm not. I think—look, these folks have been absolutely amazing. What I was upset with is not having all the facts that were available to the last outfit, that we did not know. So we were under the distinct impression there was significantly more vaccine available to begin to be distributed; that it was a distribution problem—which it is and was, but that wasn't the main problem; it was having enough. And then, getting—you know, there's a big difference—the logistical difference between having a vaccine sent to the States in bulk and refrigerated, and having vaccinators with the paraphernalia to put it into a vial and stick it in someone's arm—is a very different and logistical problem—difficult problem. So there's the vaccine. There is the access to the vaccine, in terms of how you get it where it has to be. That is a giant logistical issue, and we're solving that now. For example, we are, as of—was it today, Jeff? We're doing—we're making sure that all these Federal systems, community—— Coordinator Zients. Community health centers. The President. ——community health centers that are federally run—we are getting them—what day are we getting—— Coordinator Zients. Starting next week. The President. Starting next week, they'll get—— Coordinator Zients. And pharmacies start today. The President. And the pharmacies start today. We thought, by listening—at least my team did—between the time we were elected and the time somebody recognized we were elected, that we thought that it was well underway; that the drugstores were beginning—you know, all the places—the Walmarts of the world—were ready. But it turned out they weren't. And so we—it's been a hell of a learning process. [Laughter] But you have done an enormous, enormous—all—every other scientist I've talked to across the board said the idea that it would end in less than a year—you'd come up with a vaccine—— [The press was escorted out, and the tour continued.]"
"Feb 12, 2021",Remarks Prior to Meeting With Governors and Mayors To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation,"Good afternoon, folks. I had a little discussion with my friends behind me, Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci, about whether or not I should take my mask off. And the truth is, although we're more than 10 feet away, I think it's important that I not. It's critically important the message—and I realize I'm speaking to a vast majority—at least, I hope I am—of the folks out here at NIH. You know that wearing this mask through the next year here can save lives, a significant numbers of lives. And so I apologize if you don't hear me as clearly as you—maybe you should. I'd like to start off by thanking Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci for hosting me today. I spent a lot of time working with Dr. Collins on the Cancer Institute matters. And I said he's the first person I called to ask if he'd stay. But then, I was reminded: I called Dr. Fauci before I got elected and said, ""Would you stay if I came?"" [Laughter] So thank you both for staying. Our Nation is fortunate to have both of you in this—in these critical roles. And that goes for the world-class doctors, scientists, researchers here at the NIH. And I just toured the Vaccine Research Center with Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci and Dr. Graham and Dr. Corbett. It's incredible. It's a place to go where you—our top minds spend years researching vaccines and treatments for all kinds of viruses, and partnering with academia and industry to prepare for the next one, because there will be others: HIV, influenza, SARS, MERS, West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and today, COVID-19. To all—to all of you, your work made possible the remarkably rapid development of COVID—19 vaccines we have today. It's incredible. Initially, people were talking years, if not decades, before we'd have a vaccine. On behalf of a grateful nation—and I don't say that lightly—on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank you and your families for your work and your sacrifice, for there is no doubt your families sacrificed a great deal for the endless hours you put in to save the rest of us. And I know it wasn't easy. The devastation of this pandemic—the loss of life and livelihoods—hasn't spared the scientific community: labs closed, research delayed, careers disrupted, especially for those in training. Yet, with every moment of despair in this past year, you and all the heroes and heroines on the frontlines of the—and the frontiers of this pandemic remind us who we are. We are America. We never give up. We never give in. We give back, and we follow the science and find the answers. That's what all of you do here. That's what we've seen all across the country. The scientific community repurposed labs to work on COVID-19, develop therapeutics, new diagnostics technologies, and vaccines in record time. And you're highlighting lessons learned on the importance of pandemic preparedness, public-private partnerships, real-time data-sharing, and most of all, speed and efficiency without compromising science and good conscience. Look, you're an incredible group of people. I've been out here many times trying to help—trying to help my son who passed away with cancer. You're an incredible, incredible group of people. And that's not hyperbole. We still—what we know is, we still have a long way to go. It's no secret that the vaccination program was in much worse shape than my team and I anticipated. We were under the impression, I'm told, that we had a lot more resources than we did when we came into office. We've only been here 3 weeks, but we've learned a great deal in those 3 weeks. While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor—I'll be very blunt about it—did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans. He didn't order enough vaccines. He didn't mobilize enough people to administer the shots. He didn't set up the Federal vaccine centers where eligible people could go and get their shots. When I became President 3 weeks ago, America had no plan to vaccinate most of the country. It was a big mess. It's going to take time to fix, to be blunt with you. I promised, when I did my Inaugural Address, that I'd always be straight with you, give it to you straight from the shoulder: I will not walk away when we make a mistake; I'll acknowledge it and tell you the truth. We started on day one. We won't have everything fixed for a while, but we're going to fix it. First, the vaccine. I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, listen to Dr. Fauci. I did. I got my shots. My wife Jill did. Kamala did, and her husband Doug did. So Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins got it also. It's safe. And we need more people to get vaccinated to beat this pandemic. That's why, in the first 3 weeks that I've been in office, we've increased the supply of weekly vaccine shipments to the States by almost 30 percent. That means millions more Americans will get vaccinated in February than the previous administration was on track to do. But that's just the start. We bought more vaccines. Two weeks ago, I directed Jeff Zients, who's here with me—my COVID-19 Response Coordinator—to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase more vaccines. Just this afternoon we signed the final contracts for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines. And we're also able to move up the delivery dates with an additional 200 million vaccines to the end of July, faster than we expected. And in further good news, both companies agreed—and we're now contractually obligated—to expedite delivery of 100 million doses, that were promised by the end of June, to deliver them by the end of May. That's a month faster. That means lives will be saved. That means we're now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July. It may not sound like the urgent progress we need, but let's be clear: When I took office, just 3 weeks ago, this country did not have a plan or enough vaccines or people to vaccinate Americans—any—all Americans, at any time, in any point in 2021. Within 3 weeks, round-the-clock work with so many people—people standing behind me and in front of me—we've now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans. And now we're working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people. In just 3 weeks, you deployed over 1,000 Federal staff to vaccination sites around the country. We're helping give shots and set up and speed up vaccination operations. To date, we've also provided $3 billion to 37 States and Territories and Tribes to bolster existing vaccination centers and create more of the centers to administer—where we administer the vaccine. For example, 3 days ago, Vice President Harris and I, we had a virtual tour of a federally supported vaccine center in a parking lot of the Arizona Cardinal stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It's open 24/7. Folks who are eligible can call by phone or sign up online for an appointment. They literally drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, get a card, and schedule the next shot. On average, it's about 30 minutes from start to finish. In just 3 weeks, the site has administered 160,000 doses, now averaging 8,000 vaccinations through the day and night. Look, it's coordination between State and Federal Government, and the private sector partnership is essential. One of the nurses coordinating the effort in Arizona said the work was like administering—and I love this phrase, Doc—she said, ""like administering a dose of hope."" Like administering a dose of hope. Let me say that: a dose of hope. We're going to get those doses of hope out at new and large-scale vaccination centers that were set up by the Federal Government. During the Super Bowl, we got a call from the NFL. The commissioner of football, Goodell, said we could have access to all 30 of the NFL stadiums for mass vaccination sites. We just announced we've worked with the Governors to set up these new federally run sites in California, New York, Texas, with many more to come. We're going to target communities that have been the hardest hit, and it will be staffed by our military; the Federal Emergency Management Association [Agency]*—FEMA—same people who respond to hurricanes and storms, and the like; and other Federal experts at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Department of Agriculture to get vaccinators to make sure it gets in people's arms. When I got to office, there was no Federal plan—none—to ship vaccines directly to local pharmacies. So folks who are allowed to get vaccination under the State rules, as the allocation of who gets in line, are allowed to get one, can schedule an appointment now and get COVID-19 vaccine shots like they would a flu shot from their pharmacy. And we'll start today—that program. And for folks who can't get to a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile units and sending vaccination—vaccines to community health centers—federally run community health centers—to take care of the poorest of the poor, that reach the hardest hit in those underserved areas in the country—Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. This is an important piece to ensure racial equity remains at the center of our COVID—19 response, which is something, I know, Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci are focused on as well. Another point of progress is, we're deploying more vaccinators. We're now allowing retired doctors and nurses to come back and administer shots. We're deploying Federal vaccinators, and over the last 3 weeks, we put hundreds of new vaccinators in the field and are lining up thousands more. These include medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as personnel from FEMA, the Defense Department, and more departments to come. All told, we're on track to surpass the goal I set on day one. When I was sworn in, I indicated—just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my hope was to administer 100 million shots in the first 100 days of our term. I believe we'll not only reach that, but we'll break that. But like I said before, that's just the floor. That's just the floor. Our end goal is beating COVID-19. Which brings us to the challenge that remains. We remain in the teeth of this pandemic. January of 2021 was the deadliest month we've had. We lost over 100,000—100,000—of our fellow citizens. We're on track to cross 500,000 dead Americans this next month. The new strains emerging create immense challenges, and masking is still the easiest thing to do to save lives. But we need everyone to mask up. And by the way, I know it's a pain in the neck, but it's a patriotic responsibility. We're in the middle of a war with this virus. It's a patriotic responsibility, not only if you care about your family, if you care about your fellow Americans. You realize more people have died in the last 12 months than died in all 4 years in World War II? All 4 years. That's why I asked what the full extent of my authority as President of the United States could be. I signed an Executive order that required masking on all Federal property, on modes of travel like planes, trains, and buses across interstate commerce. And I've been calling on Governors—Republican and Democrat—and mayors—Republican and Democrat—and local officials to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and yes, for their country. Mask up, America. Mask up. And to really get ahead of this pandemic instead of chasing it, we need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. And I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly. And my hope is that we'll get Republicans, as well as Democrats, to support us. But we can't wait. People are dying every minute from this pandemic. And we're suffering a profound economic crisis that the pandemic has created. Every major economist in the country—left, right, and center—says we can't go big enough here. And if we want to get our economy back in shape, we've got to move quickly. How many of you out there don't have enough food to eat? How many of you out there are worried whether you can pay next month's rent or pay your mortgage? How many of you out there have a child at home because a school is not open and you have to make the difficult choice of staying home with your child or going to work if you have a job? This is not who we are. In the United States of America, we take care of our own. And job number one of the American Rescue Plan is fighting the pandemic. It puts $160 billion into our national COVID strategy, which includes more money for testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms. The American Rescue Plan also includes $4 billion to build new manufacturing plants. So we are ready to manufacture vaccines we don't—and we don't have to wait. You know, there's simply nothing more important than getting the resources we need to vaccinate people in this country as quickly as possible—as quickly as possible. We're not going to get our economy back in shape and millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. As I said, everyone from Moody's on Wall Street to a whole range of other think tanks indicates that if we do this plan, we'll get to full employment within 2 years. We'll be in a situation where we actually grow the economy, creating millions of jobs immediately and put us in a position where we are going to have the GDP grow at a higher rate than under—if we don't do this. We're in a national emergency. I want to close with this: We're in a national emergency. And this will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever undertaken as a nation. It's going to take time. We're going to face setbacks along the way. And I promise you, when we do, I'll just own up to it and say what they are. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to stay focused. And for God's sakes, we have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America. We can do this. We have the resources. We just have to choose to use them. We have to do what all of you do here at NIH and across the scientific community: Keep the faith with purpose and vision and with every dose of hope we have. Folks, remember, like I said: This is America. We have never, never, never failed. We've decided to stand together and act together. That's who we are. That's not chauvinism; that's just a fact. We've never failed when we stood together. If there's ever a time we need to stand together, it's now. May God bless you all, and may God bless everyone here at NIH—all the doctors, scientists, and researchers fighting this pandemic and saving lives. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much. You're the best America has to offer here at NIH. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"Feb 16, 2021","Remarks and a Question-and-Answer Session at a CNN Presidential Town Hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Hello, everybody. Thanks for coming in. I'm fortunate to have today a group of leading Governors and mayors of both political parties to talk about the COVID plan we've put forward, and their needs and their ideas and their recommendations on how to proceed. And the American Rescue Plan is—has multiple pieces. The most important piece, in my view, is making sure we give them enough capacity to deal with the virus in their States and how we're going to do that. But equally consequential is the need to help the States economically, in terms of everything from unemployment to being able to make sure that they're able to get kids back in schools and what role the Federal Government should play in helping the—getting that done. And you know, we've—these folks are all on the frontlines. They've been dealing with this crisis from day one. It's—I'm not making a political statement; it just, it's taken a while to adjust. They've been left on their own, in many cases. I think some have found what I found when I got here: that what we thought was available, in terms of everything from vaccine to vaccinators, was not the case. So I thank them for the work they did in their cities and their States in order to respond to the crisis. But I think it's—and I've said it plainly when I was running and as President—that I think the Federal Government has a major role to play here. But these are the folks that are on the ground dealing with it every single solitary day. And they see the pain, and they see the successes when they occur. And what I really want to know about is what should that—the recovery plan—should we have more or less of anything in it; what do they think they need most; how to proceed. Because, as I've said before, you know, Governors and mayors, that's a real job. I was a Senator for years. I got on a train every day and came to Washington, DC, and I'd get asked questions by the conductors and the shoeshine guys and the ticket masters and—but every single day, these folks are home. Every single day, they're meeting with their constituents. We're down here in Washington, and we meet with them. I don't mean to belittle them at all, but it's not the same as being on the ground. And so whenever I want to know what's really happening, I want to talk—and I'm not being solicitous—to Governors and mayors. And so thank you for being here. And that's what we're going to be doing today. Thank you all."
"Feb 17, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Labor Leaders To Discuss Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper. And welcome. We are live in the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a CNN Presidential town hall, the first with President Joe Biden. I'm Anderson Cooper. President Biden is just 4 weeks into his Presidency and facing multiple crises: nearly 500,000 of our fellow citizens—Americans—have died from COVID-19, millions out of work right now, and a nation dangerously divided. Tonight we're going to be answering questions from the American people. The President will be answering questions from the American people on his first official trip since taking office. Some of the questioners here voted for him. Some did not. The President and I will not be wearing masks on this stage. He, of course, has been vaccinated. Over the past several weeks, I have repeatedly tested negative for coronavirus—as recently as yesterday and this morning as well. We will however be keeping our distance from one another, and the audience is very limited, socially distanced, and all wearing masks when they're seated. With that, I want to welcome the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden. The President. Hey, Anderson. Mr. Cooper. How are you, sir? The President. Good to see you, man. Hey, folks. How are you? It's good to be back, man. Mr. Cooper. Yes, it's nice to see you, sir. The President. And you know you enjoy being home with the baby more. I don't want to hear this. Mr. Cooper. [Laughter] I do. Yes. He's 9½ months, so I'm very happy. The President. I get it. No, no, everybody knows I like kids better than people. [Laughter] Mr. Cooper. I saw a picture of you with your grandson recently. The President. That's right. That's right. Mr. Cooper. Yes. So we've got a lot of questions in the audience. We have about 50 or so people here. They're all socially distanced. We have some folks who voted for you, some folks who did not. And we're going to get as many questions in as possible. Before we get to that, I just want to start with a couple of just big-picture questions about the pandemic and where we are right now. The President. Sure. Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts  Mr. Cooper. New cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations have fallen by half in the last month, so have new cases. That's the good news. There's this potential threat—potential surge from the variants coming down the pike potentially. When is every American who wants it going to be able to get a vaccine? The President. By the end of July of this year. We have—when we came into office, there was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now—by the end of July, we'll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American. Mr. Cooper. When you say ""by the end of July,"" do you mean that they will be available or that people will have been able to actually get them? Because Dr. Fauci—— The President. They'll be available. Mr. Cooper. They'll be available. The President. They'll be available. Mr. Cooper. Okay. The President. Here, look, we—what we did—we got into office and found out the supply—there was no backlog. I mean, there was nothing in the refrigerator, figuratively and literally speaking, and there were 10 million doses a day that were available. We've upped that, in the first 3 weeks that we were in office, to significantly more than that. We've moved out—went to the Pfizer and Moderna and said, ""Can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly?"" They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400—then they've agreed to go to 600 million doses. And that's—and they're—and we got them to move up the time because we used the national Defense Act to be able to help the manufacturing piece of it to get more equipment and so on. Mr. Cooper. So if, end of April—excuse me, end of July, they're available to actually get them in the arms of people who want them, that will take—what?—a couple more months? The President. Well, no, a lot will be being vaccinated in the meantime. Mr. Cooper. Okay. The President. In other words, it's not all of a sudden 600 million doses are going to appear. And what's going to happen is: It's going to continue to increase as we move along, and we'll have reached 400 million by the end of May and 600 million by the middle of—by the end of July. And the biggest thing, though, as you remember when you and I—no, I shouldn't say it that way, ""as you remember""—but when you and I talked last, we talked about—it's one thing to have the vaccine, which we didn't have when we came into office, but a vaccinator—how do you get the vaccine into someone's arm? So you need the paraphernalia. You need the needle, and you need mechanisms to be able to get it in. You have to have people who can inject it into people's arms. Mr. Cooper. That's been one of the problems is just getting enough people. The President. Yes, now we have—we have made significant strides increasing the number of vaccinators. I've—I issued an Executive order allowing former retired docs and nurses to do it. We have over 1,000 military personnel. The CDC is—I mean, excuse me, the—we have gotten the National Guard engaged. So we have significant number of vaccinators, people who would actually be there. Plus, we've opened up a considerable number of locations where you can get the vaccination. Mr. Cooper. I want to introduce you to Kevin Michel. He's an Independent from Wauwatosa. He's a mechanical engineer for a vehicle company. Kevin, welcome. What's your question? Q. Hi, welcome to Milwaukee. The President. How you doing? Q. Good. My question is regarding education. The President. Yes. School Reopening Efforts  Q. And considering that hybrid and virtual school instruction have been in place for nearly a year now, what is the plan and recommendation to get students back into the brick-and-mortar buildings? As a parent of four children, I find it imperative that they get back to school as safely as possible. The President. My mother would say: ""God bless you, son. No purgatory for you""—four kids home. I really mean it. And by the way, the loss of being able to be in school is having significant impact on the children and parents as well. And so, what we found out is, there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick-and-mortar building. One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear—it's available to students, as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers. Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that's why we need more teachers. Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes in that same—of 10 kids each in those. And I'm making the number up—less. It doesn't have to be literally 10. In addition to that, we also have indicated that it is much better, it's much easier to send kids K-through-8 back because they are less likely to communicate the disease to somebody else. But because kids in—sophomores, juniors, and seniors in high school—they socialize a lot more, and they're older, and they transmit more than young kids do, it's harder to get those schools open without having everything from new ventilation systems and having—— For example, school bus drivers—you know, we've got to make sure that you don't have 60 kids, or however many there—depending on the size of school bus—sitting two abreast in every single seat. And so there's a lot of things we can do, short of—and I think that we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy as well. Mr. Cooper. Well, let me ask you, you—your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days. You're now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least 1 day a week. The President. No, that's not true. That's what was reported, but that's not true. Mr. Cooper. Oh. The President. There was a mistake in the communication. But what I've—what I'm talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K-through-eighth grade because they're the easiest to open, the most needed to be opened, in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay home. Mr. Cooper. So when do you think that would be: K-through-8, at least 5 days a week if possible? The President. I think we'll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days. We've had a significant percentage of them being able to be opened. My guess is, they're going to probably be pushing to open all for—all summer—to continue like it's a different semester—to try to catch up. Mr. Cooper. Do you think that would be 5 days a week or just a couple? The President. I think many of them, 5 days a week. The goal will be 5 days a week. Now, it's going to be harder to open up the high schools for the reasons I said—just like, if you notice, the contagion factor in colleges is much higher than it is in high schools or grade schools. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet—this is Justin Belot. He's a high school teacher from Milwaukee who's a Democrat. Justin, thanks for being with us. What's your question? The President. What do you teach? Q. I teach English. High school English. The President. My wife teaches. God love you, fella. School Reopening Efforts/Vaccination of School Staff  Q. Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. President. So along the same lines of schools, so this great debate on when to transition to in-person learning: While there are numerous warnings not to be in large groups or to have dinner parties or small parties, why is it okay to put students and teachers in close proximity to each other for an entire day, day after day? With large class sizes and outdated ventilation systems, how and when do you propose this to occur? And finally, do you believe all staff should be vaccinated before doing so? The President. Number one, nobody is suggesting, including the CDC in this recent out report, that you have large classes, congested classes. It's smaller classes; more ventilation; making sure that everybody has masks and is socially distanced, meaning you have less—fewer students in one room; making sure that everyone from the sanitation workers who work in the—in the lavatories, in the bathrooms, and do the—all the maintenance, that they are in fact able to be protected as well. Making sure you're in a situation where you don't have the congregation of a lot of people—as I said, including the school bus, including getting on a school bus. So it's about needing to be able to socially distance, smaller classes, more protection. And I think that teachers and the folks who work in the school—the cafeteria workers and others——should be on the list of preferred to get a vaccination. Mr. Cooper. I want to introduce you to Kerri Engebrecht, an Independent from Oak Creek. Kerri, welcome. Go ahead. Q. Thank you. The President. Kerri, how are you? Coronavirus Vaccine Accessibility/Johnson and Johnson Vaccine Development  Q. Very good, thank you. Our 19-year-old son was diagnosed with pediatric COPD at the age of 14. We're told he has the lungs of a 60-year-old. He does all he can to protect himself. Last month, he even removed himself from the campus of UW-Madison, as he feels it's safer and he has less exposure here at home. We've tried all we can to get him a vaccine. I hear of others who are less vulnerable getting it based on far less. Do you have a plan to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable sooner, to give them a priority? The President. Well, the answer is: Yes, there are. But here's how it works: The States make the decision on who is—or in what order. I can make recommendations, and for Federal programs, I can do that as President of the United States. But I can't tell the State, ""You must move such and such a group of people up."" But here's what I'd like to do: If you're willing, I'll stay around after this is over, and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if I can get you some help. Mr. Cooper. Let me just ask you though: Johnson and Johnson could be authorized—a new vaccine from them could be authorized in a couple of weeks. That would be a big deal—— The President. Yes, it would. Mr. Cooper. ——bringing a lot more vaccines on, millions of more doses to the supply. Once that happens, given the urgency of these variants and the potential threat from them, should states stop giving priority to certain groups and just open vaccine access for everyone? The President. Well, it depends on how much they have available. I think there still should be priority groups in case there are not enough for everyone, every—available to everybody. And look, we don't know for certain. Let me tell you what my national COVID team has said: that the variants—I mean by ""variants,"" you mean the Brazilian strain, the South African strain, the British strain—— Mr. Cooper. London. Yes. The President. ——and London, et cetera. There's thus far—thus far—there is no evidence that the existing vaccinations available for Moderna and Pfizer do not either make sure that they apply—they work as well against the strain in the United States. And there is no evidence that they're not helpful. So if you can get a vaccination, get it whenever you can get it, regardless of the other strains that are out there. There are studies going on to determine it is not only more communicable, but are there vaccine—do the vaccines not provide helpful protection by getting the vaccine. There are some speculation. I shouldn't—I've got to be very careful, right?—because millions of people are watching this. It may be that a certain vaccination for a certain strain may reduce from 95 percent to a lower percentage of certainty that it will keep you from getting—— Mr. Cooper. It may not be as effective as—— The President. It may not be as effective. Mr. Cooper. ——against a variant, but it still would be effective. The President. It'd still be effective. So the clear notion is: If you're eligible, if it's available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet—this is Dessie Levy, a Democrat from Milwaukee. She's a registered nurse, former academic dean. She's also currently director of a faith-based nonprofit. Dessie, welcome. The President. By the way—you've heard me say this before, Becky [Dessie]*—if there's any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. I can tell you as a consumer of health care—my family. You're wonderful. Thank you for what you do. Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Vaccine Accessibility in African American and Hispanic Communities  Q. God bless you. Mr. President, hello. My name is Dr. Dessie Levy. And my question to you is: Considering COVID-19 and its significant impact on Black Americans, especially here in Milwaukee, and thus the exacerbation of our racial disparities in health care, we have seen less than 3 percent of Blacks and less than 5 percent of Hispanics, given the total number of vaccines that have been administered to this point. Is this a priority for the Biden administration? And how will the disparities be addressed? And that's both locally and nationally. The President. Well, first of all, it is a priority, number one. Number two, there's two reasons for it being the way it is. Number one, there is some history of Blacks being used as guinea pigs and other experiments—I need not tell you, Doctor—over the last 50 to 75 to 100 years in America. So there's a—there is a concern about getting the vaccine, whether it's available or not. But the biggest part of it is access, physical access. That's why, last week, I opened up—I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would—all of the Federal—all of the community health centers now, which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses, you know, a week, in how we're going to move forward, because they're in the neighborhood. Secondly, we have opened up—and I'm making sure that there's doses of vaccine for over 6,700 pharmacies, because almost everyone lives within—not always walking distance, but within the distance of being able to go to the pharmacy, like when you got your flu shot. That is also now being opened. Thirdly, I also am providing for mobile vans, mobile units to go into neighborhoods that are hard to get to because people are on—for example, even though everyone is within, you know, basically 5 miles of a Walgreens, let's say, the fact is, if you're 70 years old, you don't have a vehicle, and you live in a tough neighborhood—meaning you're—it's a high concentration of COVID—you're not likely to be able to walk 5 miles to go get a vaccine. The other thing we found is—and I'm sorry to go on, but this is really important to me. The other part—portion is, a lot of people don't know how to register. Not everybody in the community—in the Hispanic and the African American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner-city districts—know how to use—know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreens or at the particular store. So we're also—I've committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there. That's why we're also trying to set up mass vaccination centers, like places in stadiums and the like. Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts  Mr. Cooper. Are you concerned about the rollout of this online? Because it has been incredibly confusing for a lot of people, not just—— The President. Sure. Mr. Cooper. ——you know, older people. It's younger people just trying to find a place to get a vaccine. The President. Yes. And I have. Because look what we inherited: We inherited a circumstance here, where—and now for the first—we did a lot in the first 2 weeks—a circumstance where, number one, there weren't many vaccinators. You didn't know where you could go get a vaccine administered to you because there was no one to put it in your arm—number one. Number two, there was very little Federal guidance; it's to say, what to look for, how to find out where, in fact, you could go. You can go online, and every single State now has a slightly different mechanism by which they say who's qualified, where you can get the vaccines, and so on. So it's all about trying to more rationalize in detail so ordinary people, like me, can understand. I mean that sincerely. I mean, I'm not—my—you know, my grandchildren can use that online—you know, make me look like I'm in, you know, the seventh century. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, so this is a process, and it's going to take time. It took us a—think of what we didn't do. And you and I talked about this during the campaign. What we didn't do from the time it hit the—it hit the United States. ""You're going to inject something in your arm, it's going to go away."" ""You're going to be in—it will all be done by Easter."" We wasted so much time. So much time. Mr. Cooper. I have another question about vaccines. This is Jessica Salas. She's an Independent from the Milwaukee, a graphic designer. Jessica, welcome. Coronavirus Transmissibility Among Children  Q. Hi, thank you. As we've been talking about, the coronavirus is very real and very scary. And it's especially scary for children who may or may not understand. My children, Layla—eight, here—and my son Matteo—seven, at home—often ask if they will catch COVID, and if they do, will they die. They are watching as others get the vaccine, and they would like to know when will kids be able to get the vaccine. The President. Well first of all, honey—what's your first name? Q. Layla. Mr. Cooper. Layla. The President. Layla. Beautiful name. First of all, kids don't get the vaccine—get COVID very often. It's unusual for that to happen. They don't—they—and there—the evidence so far is, children aren't the people most likely to get COVID, number one. Number two, we haven't even done tests yet on children as to whether or not the certain vaccines would work or not work, or what is needed. So that's—so you—you're the safest group of people in the whole world, number one. Number two, you're not likely to be able to be exposed to something and spread it to mommy or daddy. And it's not likely mommy and daddy are able to spread it to you either. So I wouldn't worry about it, baby. I promise you. But I know it's, kind of, worrisome. What—are you in first grade, second grade? Q. Second. The President. Oh, you're getting old. [Laughter] Second grade. Well, has your school—have you been in school, honey? Q. No. Q. No, we're— The President. No. See, that's—that's, kind of, a scary thing too: You don't get to go to school; you don't get to see your friends. And so what a lot of kids—and I mean—and big people too, older people—they just—their whole lives have, sort of, changed, like when it used to be. It used to be, let's go outside and play with your friends and get in the school bus and go to school, and everything was normal. And now, when things change, people get really worried and scared. But don't be scared, honey. Don't be scared. You're going to be fine. And we're going to make sure mommy is fine too. Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts  Mr. Cooper. You know, let me ask you—let me ask you, just for folks who are watching out there—there are a lot of people who are scared, and there's a lot of people—— The President. Sure. Mr. Cooper. ——who are hurting. When do you think this pandemic is—I mean, when are we—when is it going to be done? When are we going to get back to normal? The President. Well, you know, all the experts, all the committee that I put together of the leading researchers in the world and in the United States who are on this committee of mine, headed by Dr. Fauci and others, they tell me: Be careful not to predict things that you don't know for certain what's going to happen because then you'll be held accountable. I get that. But let me tell you what I think based on all that I've learned and all that I've studied and all that I think that I know. It's fairly—it's a high probability that the vaccinations that are available today—and the new one, Johnson and Johnson, God willing, will prove to be useful—that with those vaccinations, the ability to continue to spread the disease is going to diminish considerably because of what they call ""herd immunity."" And now they're saying somewhere around 70 percent of the people have to constitute; some people said 50, 60. But a significant number have to be in a position where they are—they have been vaccinated and/or they've been through it and—— Mr. Cooper. Have antibodies. The President. And have antibodies. And so, if that works that way—as my mother would say, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors—that by next Christmas, I think we'll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today. I think a year from now, when it's 22 below zero here—[laughter]—no, a year from now, I think that there'll be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, have to wear masks, et cetera. But we don't know. So I don't want to overpromise anything here. I told you when I ran and when I got elected: I will always level with you. To use Franklin Roosevelt's example, I'll shoot to—give it ""straight from the shoulder""—straight from the shoulder, what I know and what I don't know. We don't know for certain, but it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year's school—traditional school year in September, we are not significantly better off than we are today, but it matters. It matters whether you continue to wear that mask. It matters whether you continue to socially distance. It matters whether you wash your hands with hot water. It—those things matter. They matter. And that can save a lot of lives while we're getting to this point, we get to herd immunity. Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Mr. Cooper. You've made passing a COVID relief bill the focus of your first 100 days. Those on the right say the proposal is too big; some on the left say it's not big enough. Are you committed to passing $1.9 trillion bill, or is that final number still up for negotiation? The President. I'm committed to pass—look, here's—some of you are probably economists or college professors or you teach it in school. This is the first time in my career—and as you can tell, I'm over 30—[laughter]—the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over—and including the IMF and in Europe—that the overwhelming consensus is: In order to grow the economy a year or two, three, and four down the line, we can't spend too much. Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big. You may recall I managed the last experiment we had with stimulus, and it was 800—no, I don't mean it that way, but it was $800 billion. We thought we needed more than that. And we think we did. We got—we were—it ended up working, but it slowed things up by about—and it, depending who you talked to—between 6 months and a year and a half. We can come back—we can come roaring back. It's estimated that if we—by most economists, including Wall Street firms, as well as, you know, think tanks of—political think tanks—left, right, and center—it is estimated that if we pass this bill alone, we'll create 7 million jobs this year—7 million jobs this year. And so the thing we haven't talked about—and I'm not going to go on because I want to hear your question, and I apologize—we haven't talked about—I remember you and I talking during the campaign, and you had the former guy saying that, ""Well, you know, we're just going to open things up, and that's all we need to do."" We said, ""No, you've got to deal with the disease before you deal with the—with getting the economy going."" Well, the fact is that the economy now has to be dealt with. And what is—look at all the people. You have over 10 million people unemployed. We need unemployment insurance. We need to make sure that, you know, you have 40 percent of the children in America are—talk about food shortage—60 percent of—did you ever think you'd see a day, Milwaukee—you'd see in the last 6 months, people lining up in their automobiles for an hour, for as far as you can see, to get a bag of food? What—I mean, this is the United States of America, for God's sake. We can't deal with that? We promised—look at all the people who are on the verge of being kicked out of their apartments because they cannot afford the rent. What happens when that happens? Everything being—look at all the mom-and-pop landlords that are in real trouble if we don't subsidize this in the meantime. Look at all the people who are on the verge of missing—and how many people have missed their last two mortgage payments and are able to be foreclosed on. That's why I took executive action to say they cannot be foreclosed on in the meantime. Because look at what the impact on the economy would be. You think it's bad now, let all that happen. Look at all the people who've lost their insurance. How many—I'm not asking for a show of hands. How many of you had jobs with corporations or companies that provided health care? The COBRA health care. Well, guess what? The company goes under, and guess what? You lose your health insurance. Well, we should be making sure you're able to pay for that so that we keep people moving. So there's a lot—so I think bigger. And the vast majority of the serious people say bigger is better now, not spending less. Mr. Cooper. This is Randy Lange, an Independent who supported Donald Trump in 2020. Randy is the co-owner of a woodworking company here in Milwaukee. Randy, welcome. National Economy/Federal Minimum Wage  Q. Evening. You're proposing a $15 minimum wage. Given the lower cost of living, specifically in the Midwest, many business owners are concerned that this will put them out of business, forcing them to downsize or cut benefits. How can you instill confidence in small businesses that this will benefit the Midwest business growth? The President. Well, first of all, the South is not much different than the Midwest in that regard as well. But here's the thing: If you look back over the last 40 years, as minimum wages increased, people haven't—the end result of net employment hasn't changed. The vast majority of economists—and there are studies that show that by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it could have an impact on a number of businesses, but it would be de minimis, et cetera. Here's the deal: It's about doing it gradually. We're at $7.25 an hour. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. But it's totally legitimate for small-business owners to be concerned about how that changes. For example, if it went—if we gradually increased it—when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by—to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now. That's what it would be. Mr. Cooper. The Congressional Budget Office says that a $15 minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty, but would also cost 1.4 million people their jobs. Is that—— The President. Yes, but there's also—if you read that whole thing about Pinocchios and all the rest—there are also an equal number of studies that say that's not—that wouldn't have that effect and particularly as you do it—in terms of how gradually you do it. So let's say—you said you're going to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour, between now and the year 2025, to $12 an hour, to $13—you double someone's pay—and the impact on business would be absolutely diminished, and it would grow the GDP, and it would grow, and it would generate economic growth. But it's not illegitimate as a small-business person to worry about whether or not increasing it at one fell swoop would have that impact. I do support a $15 minimum wage. I think there is equally as much, if not more, evidence to dictate that it would grow the economy and, long run and medium run, benefit small businesses as well as large businesses, and it would not have such a dilatory effect. But that's a debatable issue. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet another small-business owner. This is Tim Eichinger, a Democrat from Milwaukee, co-owner of Black Husky Brewing. Tim, welcome. Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation/Federal Assistance to Small Businesses  Q. Thank you. My partner and I own a small brewery in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, and we have nine amazing employees. We rely primarily on selling our beer out of our tap room. And with the pandemic, our business has gone down about 50 percent. Now, we've relied primarily on loans, grants, as well as our own reserves to survive. However, the new assistance has been too slow, and recently, it's gotten more restrictive on how we can apply it. What will you do so that small mom-and-pop businesses like ours will survive over large corporate entities? The President. Change it drastically, first of all, by making sure we have inspectors general. You may remember when the first bill passed, you may remember there was a guy running, saying: ""What's going to happen is the banks aren't going to lend you the money. They're going to ask you a question, 'Do you have your credit with us? How many loans do you have with us? What is your—what credit cards do you have with us? How""—because even though they were being underwritten, and we bailed their rear ends out—last time out, they weren't—it was too much trouble to lend to you. What did the President do? And I don't want to pick on the President—I shouldn't—I don't—I'm tired of talking about Donald Trump. I don't want to talk about him anymore. But the last administration spent time—a lot of time—talking about how there was no need for inspector generals. We find out that 40 percent of the money—the PPE loans to go to—PPP loans that go to small businesses went to—went to corporations that were multimillion-dollar corporations. And you're going to see an investigation showing that a lot of this was fraudulent where it went. So what I'm doing is, I'm providing $60 billion for you to be able to make capital investments in order to be able to open safely and make sure you're in a position that you can do the things that are recommended. You've noticed, there's been very little Federal direction for you all as to how to safely open your businesses. Yet you know, if you're able to test your employees, if you're able to be in a situation if you serve people, you have Plexiglas dividers; if you—a whole range. If you're able to have everybody with a mask and the like, you can do so much to safely open, but you don't get that direction. So the money, I guarantee you, is going to go to small businesses with people. And I'm shooting—and by the way, the original definition of a small business is 500 or fewer employees. Well, that's not what I mean by small businesses. What we meant by small business is the mom-and-pop businesses—hold communities together and keep people together, and particularly in neighborhoods where if you don't have a beauty shop, a barber shop, a hardware store, a grocery store, et cetera, the center of the community begins to disintegrate some. So what I'd like to do is, if you are willing to give me an address, lay out for you precisely—without taking more time, I'm going to get in trouble; I'm supposed to only talk 2 minutes in an answer—[laughter]—is to let you know exactly how that $60 billion in part of the recovery package will go to small businesses. Mr. Cooper. Right. We're going to take a quick break. When we get back, we'll have more questions for the President of the United States, Joe Biden. We'll be right back. [At this point, there was a commercial break begins.] Former President Donald J. Trump  Mr. Cooper. And welcome back. We're live at a CNN town hall event at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with President Joe Biden. We are back. Thanks so much for being here. We—before we get back into—to the audience, I wanted to ask just a question about what we just witnessed. Before the Senate voted to acquit the former President in the impeachment trial, you said you were anxious to see if Republican Senators would stand up. Only seven did. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the rest ""cowards."" Do you agree with her? The President. I'm not going to call names out. I—look, I—for 4 years, all that's been in the news is Trump. The next 4 years, I want to make sure all in the news is the American people. I'm tired of talking about Trump. It's done. Mr. Cooper. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the former President is, quote, ""still liable for everything he did while he was in office."" If your Department of Justice wanted to investigate him, would you allow them to proceed? The President. I made it clear: One of the things about—one of the most serious pieces of damage done by the last administration was the politicizing of the Justice Department. Any of you who are lawyers know—whether you're a Democrat, Republican, conservative, or liberal—it has been more politicized than any Justice Department in American history. I made a commitment: I will not ever tell my Justice Department—and it's not mine; it's the people's Justice Department—who they should and should not prosecute. Their prosecutorial decisions will be left to the Justice Department, not me. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet Joel Berkowitz from Shorewood. He is a Democrat, a professor of Foreign Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Joel, thanks for being here. Q. Thank you, Anderson. Good evening, Mr. President. The President. I'm not bad at the literature part, but after 5 years of French, I still can't speak a word. So I apologize. [Laughter] Q. I'll teach you some Yiddish sometime. How's that? The President. I—hey, by the way, I understand a little bit of Yiddish. [Laughter] Q. I'm sure you do. Mr. Cooper. It would be a shonda if you didn't. But—[laughter]. The President's Efforts To Combat White Supremacy Groups  Q. More seriously, Mr. President, like millions of my fellow citizens, I was shaken by the attack on the Capitol on January 6, and on our democracy more broadly, by your predecessor and his followers. While I appreciate efforts being made to bring them to justice, I worry about ongoing threats to our country from Americans who embrace White supremacy and conspiracies that align with it. What can your administration do to address this complex and wide-ranging problem? The President. It is complex, it's wide ranging, and it's real. You may—I got involved in politics to begin with because of civil rights and opposition to White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan. And the most dangerous people in America continue to exist. That is the greatest threat to—terror in America: domestic terror. And so I would make sure that my Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division is focused heavily on those very folks. And I would make sure that we, in fact, focus on how to deal with the rise of White supremacy. And you see what's happening—and the studies that are beginning to be done, maybe at your university as well—about the impact of former military, former police officers, on the growth of White supremacy in some of these groups. You may remember in one of my debates with the former President, I asked him to condemn the Proud Boys. He wouldn't do it. He said, ""Stand by. Stand ready."" Or whatever the phrasing exactly was. It is a bane on our existence. It has always been. As Lincoln said, ""We have to appeal to our better angels."" And these guys are not—and women—are, in fact, demented. They are dangerous people. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet James Lewis, an Independent from Milwaukee. He's a labor attorney. James, welcome. The President. James, if I say anything you don't like, let me know right away, will you? Q. All right. You're all right. The President. About as big as a mountain. Law Enforcement Reform/Policing Best Practices/Racial Profiling/Fair Sentencing Guidelines  Q. Good evening, President Biden. I was a public defender in Kenosha County when the police shot Jacob Blake. I witnessed the city I worked in burned and devastated. And recently, District Attorney Michael Graveley denied to prosecute the police officers responsible. So my question to you is: What will your administration do to correct these wrongs that we witnessed just—not just in Kenosha, but across this country? And what will we do to bridge the gap between communities and their police? The President. Three things. First of all, I was a public defender as well, and I think it's high time that we had public defenders being paid the same as prosecutors. My son, by the way, was a great prosecutor; he was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he was a Federal prosecutor before that. And so I'm not condemning all prosecutors, but I am saying that it matters that you have adequate defense and you are able to attract people who, in fact, can live on being able to be that public defender, number one. Number two: We are pushing very hard, and I think we'll get it done—is the legislation relating to what is appropriate police behavior and studying police behavior and coming down with recommendations that are consistent with the legislation that was put in place as a consequence of all the world seeing one man shoved up against the curb and murdered after 8 minutes and 46 seconds. And so there's a number of things relating to everything from no-knock warrants and a whole range of things you know. But there's legislation that's being introduced separately. I hope it will pass. But thirdly, I think we have to deal with systemic racism that exists throughout society. And one of the things I'm going to recommend there is that we look at an entire panoply of things that affect whether or not people of color, primarily, are treated differently. And that goes through everything from prosecutorial discretion—you know, as a public defender what, by that, I mean. What happens is—it will take too long to go through the whole explanation, but let me do it—try to go quickly. What happens now is, if you in fact are, in going to—you arrest someone because they had—and you want to charge them, you can charge them with robbery or armed robbery. You charge them with armed robbery, you get a lot more time than if you don't charge with robbery. But if you want to make sure that someone who doesn't know much about their representation is able to, yes, you engage in prosecutorial misconduct by offering them to plead to, essentially—I mean, it's not the same—burglary, which gets them 2 years in probation and—so you don't even get a trial. You plead because you don't have adequate representation. You feel like everything is against you, and you're in trouble. When I did the sentencing act, that was designed to keep—make sure we had the same time for the same crime. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I looked at all 10 Federal districts—and we took 6 months to do it—and found out if you're Black, and you—or your first-time offense of being accused of burglary—and maybe you committed it, and you were White and you did the same exact crime—in all 10 districts throughout the United States of America, a person—and don't hold me to the exact numbers, but the percentages are right—if you're a first-time White guy, you'd get 2 years; you'd get 7 years if you were Black. So in order to make sure that you could not send people to jail for the same crime, I came up with this—this Sentencing Commission, which said that you—everybody who commits the crime has to receive between—instead of zero to 20 years, you drastically cut down the number of years you could go to jail. But say you have to—if you—if it's a one—first-time offense, you have to get sentenced between 1½ and 3 years. Okay? Well, what happens is prosecutors use that as a mechanism to send people to jail. It makes it look like they're—we're dealing with mandatory sentencing, which it wasn't designed to do at all. It was designed to make sure that people were treated fairly. There's much—I'm sorry to go on. There's much more to talk about, but—— Mr. Cooper. Yes. We actually have a related question over here. This is Dannie Evans, a pastor in Janesville, who works as a supervisor for the juvenile justice diversion program in Rock County. He's an Independent, voted for Donald Trump in 2020. He's also a member the State's 32-member Racial Disparity Task Force, created in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting last summer. Dannie, welcome. Law Enforcement Reform/Community Policing Practices/Police Training and Recruitment Practices/Systemic Racism  Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President. ""Defund the Police"" is discussed as an option for reforming policing; however, there are communities where people live in fear not of the police, but in fear of the violent gangs who commit crimes—— The President. Exactly. Q. ——in those neighborhoods. How can we be sure that we don't overlegislate police officers so that they can't do their job to protect the law-abiding citizens who live in these high-crime neighborhoods and yet train officers to police with compassion? The President. By, number one, not defunding the police. We have to put more money in police work so we have legitimate community policing and we're in a situation where we change the legislation. No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug. They should go to drug rehabilitation. Drug rehabilitation. Number one. We should be in a position where we change the system—of sentencing system—to one that relates to a notion of—they start telling you to—as related to making sure that what you do is, you focus on making sure that there's rehabilitation. The idea that we don't have people in prison systems learning how to be—spending the money—learning how to be mechanics, learning how to be cooks, learning how to have a profession when you get out; the idea that we deny someone, who served their time, access to Pell grants, access to housing, access to—right now, as you well know, most places you get out of prison, you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. You end up back under the bridge exactly where you were before. And the fact is that—the concern in many minority communities is Black-on-Black, Hispanic-on-Hispanic, not just—but here's the deal: There has to be much more serious—how can I say it?—much more serious determination as to what the background and the attitudes of the recruit is, where—what their views are. There should be much more psychological testing, like you would if you go into the intelligence community. What is it? What are the things that make you respond the way you do? Because there is inherent prejudice built into the system as well. And we also need to provide for—and it's happening—more African American and more Hispanic police officers. Now, by the way, they don't get it all right either, by a long shot. But every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night. Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and is about to knock somebody off. So it's about education. I'd love to talk to you more about it, because it's the answer, in my view—that and education—actually, access to education. And one of the things that I talk a lot about—and I'm sorry to go on about this, but it's important: I don't think we can look at opportunity in the—let's stick with African American community for a minute—in terms of the criminal justice system. That is only one small piece of why people are the way they are. You realize—I don't know what home you live in, but if you go ahead and you wanted to get insurance, and you're in a Black neighborhood, you're going to pay more for the same insurance that I'm going to pay for the exact same home. Your car—you never had an accident in your car. If you live in a Black neighborhood, you're going to pay a higher premium on your car. You're going to—so there's so many things that are built in institutionally that disadvantage African Americans and Latinos that we—in fact, I think—and one of the great advantages—I'm sorry, but one of the great advantages—as bad as things are—I keep reading from Presidential historians how I've inherited the worst situation since Lincoln, worse than Roosevelt, because—economic crisis, political crisis, racial crisis, et cetera. But the fact is that everyone has gotten a close-up look now and seen what's happened. That kid holding that camera for 8 minutes and 46 seconds awakened the whole world. When I met with his little daughter, after he was dead, she said, ""My daddy has changed the world."" Guess what? Not only here in the United States. Around the world, people said, ""Whoa, I didn't know that happened."" Dr. King—when my generation—when I got involved in the civil rights movement as a high school student in the early sixties—and you had Bull Connor and his dogs in the late fifties sicking on those ladies going to—in their black dresses going to church—and little kids and fire hoses ripping their skin off. He said, ""What happened there was—it was a second emancipation."" Because people in places where there weren't Black communities said: ""That really happens? I didn't believe it."" They saw it happen. And so it generated the—the Voting Rights Act. It generated the Civil Rights Act. And he called it the ""second emancipation."" We have a chance now—a chance now—to make significant change in racial disparities. And I'm going to say something that's going to get me in trouble, which—I couldn't go through the whole show without doing that. [Laughter] And that is that—think about it: If you want to know where the American public is, look at the money being spent in advertising. Did you ever, 5 years ago, think every second or third ad out of five or six you'd turn on would be biracial couples? No, no, I'm not being facetious—the reason I'm so hopeful is, this new generation—they're not like us. They're thinking differently. They're more open. And we've got to take advantage of it. Mr. Cooper. I want you to—— The President. I'm sorry. Mr. Cooper. I want you to meet Luverda Martin, a Democrat from Mequan or Mequon—— Q. Mequon. Mr. Cooper. Mequon, sorry. Luverda is a certified nurse, midwife. Welcome. Q. Good evening, Mr. President. The President. Good evening. The President's Agenda  Q. Our Nation's experiences with and through COVID-19 and other recent tragedies have strengthened the foundation of division among Americans. What are your immediate and tangible plans to address how deeply divided we are as a Nation? The President. I take issue with what everybody says about the division. For example, my plan on COVID: 69 percent of the American people support it—69. In this State—recent poll—60 percent. Sixty percent. Forty-five percent of Trump voters and fifty-five percent of Republican voters. The Nation is not divided. You go out there and take a look and talk to people. You have fringes on both ends, but it's not nearly as divided as we make it out to be. And we have to bring it together. You may remember how—trouble I get in. I said there were three reasons I was running: One, to restore the soul of the country—decency, honor, integrity; talk about the things that matter to people, treat people with dignity. Secondly, I said, to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class, and this time bring everybody along and have a chance. And the third reason was unite the country. On my own primary, I got a lot of: ""Unite the country? What are you talking about?"" You cannot function in our system without consensus, other than abusing power at the executive level. So I really think there's so many things that we agree on that we don't focus enough on. And that's, in large part, I think, because we don't just condemn the things that are so obviously wrong—obviously wrong—that everybody agrees on. The way they were raised. The way we were raised. As my mother would say, if half the things that occurred in the last campaign came out of my mouth, as she'd say as a kid, we'd wash my mouth out with soap. [Laughter] I mean, we have to be more decent and treat people with respect and just decency. Mr. Cooper. But let me—— The President. And—— Immigration Reform  Mr. Cooper. Let me ask about—a question which does often divide many people in this country: immigration. The President. Yes. Mr. Cooper. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats, expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Would you sign any immigration bill if it did not include that: a pathway for the roughly 11 million undocumented—— The President. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with—you know, what confuses people, is you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the—that are coming from camps or being held around the world. And there are four different criteria for being able to come to the United States. The vast majority of the people, those 11 million undocumented, they're not Hispanics; they're people who came on a visa—who was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane and didn't go home. They didn't come across the Rio Grande swimming—excuse me. [Laughter] And—sorry, that's the Irish in me. [Laughter] But all kidding aside. So there are a lot of things that relate—but I think that we can no longer—look, you've heard—I'm—even if you're not involved in politics at all, you've probably heard me say this a thousand times, and matter of—that everyone is entitled to be treated with decency, with dignity. Everyone is entitled to that. And we don't do that enough. For the first time in American history, if you're seeking asylum—meaning you're being persecuted, you're seeking asylum—you can't do it from the United States. You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria, and send you back if you in fact—but you can't even do that. You've got to seek asylum from abroad. Mr. Cooper. But just to be clear, though—and I know you're going to be announcing stuff later this week, or that's what I've heard—you do want a pathway to citizenship—— The President. Yes. Mr. Cooper. ——for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. The President. Yes. Mr. Cooper. And that would be essential in any bill for you? The President. Well, yes. The—but, by the way, if you came along and said to me, ""In the meantime, we can work out a system whereby we're going to""—for example, we used to allow refugees—125,000 refugees in the United States in a yearly basis. It was as high as 250,000. Trump cut it to 5,000. Come with me into Sierra Leone. Come with me into parts of Lebanon. Come with me around the world and see people piled up in camps, kids dying, no way out, refugees fleeing from persecution. We, the United States, used to do our part. We were part of that. We were—and you know, that's—you know, ""send me your huddled masses."" Come on. And so I would, if you had a refugee bill by itself—I'm not suggesting that—but I would—there's things that I would deal by itself, but not at the expense of saying, ""I'm never going to do the other."" There is a reasonable path to citizenship. And it shows up—one of the reasons why we have been able to compete with the rest of the world so well is, most of our major competitors are xenophobic. You remember quite—I remember you questioned me when I came back from China. And I said, ""I predict, within less than a year, they're going to end their 'one China policy.'"" And I got clobbered by—saying—because they said Biden didn't talk about the fact that—how immoral it was. And it was when we were running against a Republican ticket, led by Mitt Romney, a fine guy. Mr. Cooper. You just talked to China's President, I believe. The President. Yes, for 2 hours. U.S.-China Relations/Human Rights Issues in China  Mr. Cooper. What about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China? The President. We must speak up for human rights. It's who we are. We can't—my comment to him was—and I know him well, and he knows me well. We're—a 2-hour conversation. Mr. Cooper. You talked about this to him? The President. I talked about this too. And that's not so much refugee, but I talked about—I said—look, you know, Chinese leaders—if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been—the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home. So the central—to vastly overstate it—the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the ""one China"" policy by making it forceful—I said—and by the—he said he—he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they—their leaders—are expected to follow. But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was Vice President and he was the vice president—that's how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu—not a joke—his predecessor, President Hu—and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the President. And I came back and said they're going to end their one-child policy, because they're so xenophobic, they won't let anybody else in, and more people are retired than working. How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired? Mr. Cooper. When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just—is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China? The President. Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that. What I'm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker. And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries. And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do that. But it's much more complicated than that. I'm—I shouldn't have tried to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television here. Mr. Cooper. Well, let me bring it back to the United States. I want you to meet Joycelyn Fish, a Democrat from Racine. Joycelyn is the director of marketing for a community theater. Joycelyn, welcome. Your question? Q. Hello. Good evening, Mr. President. The President. Good evening. Q. Student loans are crushing my family, friends, and fellow Americans. The President. Me too. [Laughter] Student Loan Forgiveness Programs/Postsecondary Education  Q. The American Dream—— The President. You think I'm kidding. Q. ——is to succeed. But how can we fulfill that dream when debt is many people's only option for a degree? We need student loan forgiveness beyond the potential $10,000 your administration has proposed. We need at least a $50,000 minimum. What will you do to make that happen? The President. I will not make that happen. It depends on whether or not you go to a private university or public university. It depends on the idea that I say to a community, ""I'm going to forgive the debt""—the billions of dollars in debt for people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn and schools my children—I went to a great school. I went to a State school. But is that going to be forgiven, rather than use that money to provide for early education for young children who are—come from disadvantaged circumstances? But here's what I think: I think everyone—and I've been proposing this for 4 years—everyone should be able to go to community college for free. For free. That's—that costs $9 billion, and we should pay for it. And the tax policies we have now—we should be able to pay for you. We spend almost that money as a break for people who own race horses. And I think any family making under $125,000 whose kids go to a State university they get into, that should be free as well. And the thing I do in terms of student debt that's accumulated is provide for changing the existing system now for debt forgiveness if you engage in volunteer activity. For example, if you were—if you're teaching school, after 5 years, you'd lose—you would have $50,000 of your debt forgiven. If you worked in a battered women's shelter, if you worked—and so on. So you'll be able to forgive debt. Thirdly, I'm going to change the position that we have now to allow for debt forgiveness—because it's so hard to calculate—whereby you can now, depending on how much you make and what program you sought, you can work off that debt by the activity you have, and you cannot be charged more than x percent of your take-home pay so that it doesn't affect your ability to buy a car, own a home, et cetera. Each of my children graduated from school. I mortgaged the house. I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for—not a joke—for over 30 years. And—but I was able to borrow—I bought a home I spent a lot of time working on, and I was able to sell it for some profit. But my oldest son graduated, after undergraduate and graduate school, with $136,000 in debt after working 40—I mean, excuse me, 30 hours a week during school. My other son, who went to Georgetown and Yale Law School, graduated $142,000 in debt, and he worked for a parking service in—down in Washington. My daughter went to Tulane University and then got a masters at Penn. She graduated $103,000 in debt. So I don't think anybody should have to pay for that, but I do think you should be able to work it off. My daughter is a social worker. My other son became a—ran the World Food Program U.S.A., and so on. They didn't qualify. But my point is: I understand the impact of the debt, and it can be debilitating. And I think there is a whole question about what universities are doing. They don't need more skyboxes. What they need is more money invested in making—so that's why I provide, for example, $80 billion—$70 billion over 10 years for HBCUs and other minority-serving universities, because they don't have the laboratories to be able to bring in those Government contracts that can train people in cybersecurity or other future endeavors that pay well. But I do think that, in this moment of economic pain and strain, that we should be eliminating interest on the debts that are accumulated, number one. And number two, I'm prepared to write off a $10,000 debt, but not 50. Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, let me ask you—— The President. Because I don't think I have the authority to do it by the sign of the pen. The President's Adjustment to Daily Life in the White House  Mr. Cooper. You have, over the years—over your career, you've obviously spent a great deal of time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, except now you're living there and you're President. It's been 4 weeks. What's it like? How's it different? The President. I get up in the morning, look at Jill, and say, ""Where the hell are we?"" [Laughter] No, it's—look, it's—you know, I've only been President 4 weeks. And sometimes—because things are moving so fast, not because of burden—it feels like 4 years. It's not because of the burden; it's because there's so much happening that you focus on. You're constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity, one right—ad seriatum. But what happens is that it's—what I didn't realize: I had been in the Oval Office a hundred times as Vice President—or more than that, every morning, for the initial meetings—but I had never been up in the Residence. And one of the things that—I don't know about you all, but I was raised in the way that you didn't look for anybody to wait on you. And it's—we're—I find myself extremely self-conscious. There are wonderful people who work at the White House. But someone, you know, standing there and, you know, making sure I—hands me my suitcoat or—— Mr. Cooper. You'd never been in the Residence of the White House? The President. I'd only been upstairs in the Yellow Room. You know, the Oval upstairs. Mr. Cooper. I don't know, I've never been there either, but I—[laughter]. The President. No. And—but it's—but look, the people down there are wonderful. And I find that, you know—like, my dad—you've heard me say this before—my dad used to say, ""Everybody—everybody—is entitled to be treated with respect."" And it's interesting how decent and incredible these folks are. Mr. Cooper. Is it different than you expected it to be, in some ways? The President. You know, I don't know what I ever expected it to be. I—it is different in that—I'll get in trouble in here. I said when I was running, I wanted to be President not to live in the White House, but to be able to make the decisions about the future of the country. And so living in the White House, as you've heard other Presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there, has—it's a little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to but—walk outside and do things. The Vice President's residence was totally different. You're on 80 acres, overlooking the rest of the city. And you can walk out, and there's a swimming pool. You can walk off a porch in the summer and jump in a pool, and you know, go into work. You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property and work out. And you can—but the White House is very different. And I feel a sense of—I must tell you, a sense of history about it. Jon Meacham, who you know, and several other Presidential historians, helped me with my—I asked my brother, who's good at this, to set up the Oval Office for me, because it all happens within 2 hours, you know? Literally. They move everything out and move something. And it was interesting to hear these historians talk about what—what other Presidents have gone through in the moments and who were the people who stepped up to the ball and who are the people who didn't. And what you realize is the most consequential thing for me is—although I've known this watching seven Presidents who I got to know fairly well—is I always, in the past, looked at the Presidency in the terms of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt and George Washington and how can—they're superhuman. But I had to remind myself, they're really fine men that I knew well—the last seven Presidents—and at least there are people who I knew well enough to know that I can play on the same team with. So it took away the sense of: ""This is—my God, you know, I'm not Abraham Lincoln. I'm not Franklin Roosevelt. How do I deal with these problems?"" Mr. Cooper. Have you picked up the phone and called any former President yet? The President. Yes, I have. Mr. Cooper. Do you want to say who? The President. No, I don't. [Laughter] They're private conversations. [Laughter] But—and by the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and called me as well. [Laughter] Mr. Cooper. I know you don't want to talk about him, but—[laughter]. The President. No, but, look, it's a—it's the greatest honor I think an American can be given, from my perspective. And I literally pray that I have the capacity to do for the country what you all deserve need be done. But one thing I learned after 8 years with Barack is, no matter how consequential the decision—I got to be the last person in the room with him, literally, on every decision—I can make a recommendation, but I walked out of the room, and it was all him, man. Nobody else. The buck stops there. And that's where you pray for making sure that you're looking at the impact on the country and a little bit of good luck at the judgment you're making. Mr. Cooper. Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us—— The President. Thank you. Mr. Cooper. ——in this town hall. We want to thank our audience for being here, for their questions. We also want to thank the Pabst Theater for hosting us."
"Feb 19, 2021","Remarks at the Munich Security Conference ""Special Edition 2021"" and an Exchange With Reporters","The President. Everybody, come on in. Don't get hurt. Every once in a while, as President, you get to invite close friends into the Oval. [Laughter] I was kidding these guys before. This is American labor. And I said from the beginning of my campaign, throughout my whole career: The middle class built this country, and labor built the middle class. And I think we have an incredible opportunity to make some enormous progress in creating jobs—good-paying jobs, Davis-Bacon, prevailing wage jobs—to rebuild the infrastructure of this country in a way that everybody knows has to be done. I promised these—and a lot of these folks have been my friends for a long, long, long time. As they say in parts of my State, ""These are the folks that brung me to the dance."" And I appreciate their friendship. And as I said—when some of you were in here when I was with the business community, I said I want to make it clear I'm a labor guy, and there's no reason why it's inconsistent with business growing either. So what we're doing here today, we're—I asked them to come in—we want to talk about the recovery act we have here that we're trying to pass—and I think it's going to get done—and building infrastructure in this country. We are so far behind the curve. We rank something like 38th in the world in terms of our infrastructure—everything from canals to highways to airports to—everything we can do, and we need to do, to make ourselves competitive in the 21st century. And so the Vice President and I are looking forward to this meeting, and we're going to have a good conversation. And I think, you know, American workers and the whole economy is going to grow in a way that we haven't seen it grow in a long time. This is the time for us to move. So, at any rate, I'll let you know. We're going to have a long conversation here. I don't know how long, but we're going to have a conversation as long as they're willing to put up with me, and talk about how we're going to get this done. So thank you all for coming in. Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, what did you learn from Americans last night about what they want in this plan? The President. I learned, based on the polling data, they want everything that's in the plan. Not a joke. Everything that's in the plan. I—the fact is that I'd like to—I asked a rhetorical question: Those who oppose the plan, what don't they like? What particular program don't they like? Don't they want to help people with nutrition? Don't they want to help people be able to pay their mortgages? Don't they want to help people get their unemployment insurance? Don't they want to make sure that people are able to stay in their homes without being thrown out of their homes in the middle of this god-awful pandemic? What don't they like? And—but the truth of the matter is, the polling data from last night, and all the polls you've all done—they come from you guys; not you personally, but your networks and your organizations—show that somewhere between 64 and 69 percent of the American people think we have to do this. And it's not about the money; it's about in order to do everything from open schools, as we should, to make sure that we're generating income for people who are in real trouble. It's about how much it costs. The Federal Government has to chip in, make sure we get this done. And as I said, almost every major economist in the country, and International Monetary Fund as well, says it's going to grow the economy. And that's what we're talking about here. We're going to talk about how we grow the economy. So thank you all for coming. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel  Q. Anything about Netanyahu? The President. A good conversation."
"Feb 19, 2021","Remarks at a Pfizer Incorporated Manufacturing Facility and an Exchange With Reporters in Kalamazoo, Michigan","[The President spoke from the White House via videoconference.] The President. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. And it's great to be with Angela and Emmanuel. We just spent part of—from Washington's perspective—the morning together. But I want to say hello to everyone and thanks, you—at the Munich Conference for hosting this special session. For decades, as you pointed out, I've participated in the Munich Security Conference—as a U.S. Senator, joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to affirm the importance of the transatlantic partnership; three times as the Vice President of the United States, including delivering the first international foreign policy address of the Obama-Biden administration in the first months we were in office. And 2 years ago, as you pointed out, when I last spoke at Munich, I was a private citizen; I was a professor, not an elected official. But I said at that time, ""We will be back."" And I'm a man of my word. America is back. I speak to you today as President of the United States at the very start of my administration, and I'm sending a clear message to the world: America is back. The transatlantic alliance is back. And we are not looking backward; we are looking forward, together. It comes down to this: The transatlantic alliance is a strong foundation—the strong foundation—on which our collective security and our shared prosperity are built. The partnership between Europe and the United States, in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century. The challenges we face today are different. We're at an inflection point. When I spoke to you as a Senator and as even as Vice President, the global dynamics have shifted. New crises demand our attention. And we cannot focus only on the competition among countries that threaten to divide the world or only on global challenges that threaten to sink us all together if we fail to cooperate. We must do both, working in lockstep with our allies and partners. So let me erase any lingering doubt: The United States will work closely with our European Union partners and the capitals across the continent—from Rome to Riga—to meet the range of shared challenges we face. We continue to support the goal of a Europe whole and free and at peace. The United States is fully committed to our NATO alliance, and I welcome your—Europe's growing investment in the military capabilities that enable our shared defense. You know, to me and to the United States, and to us, we'll keep article—we'll keep faith with article 5. It's a guarantee. An attack on one is an attack on all. That is our unshakable vow. And the only time article 5 has been invoked was after the United States was attacked on 9/11. You, our allies, joined us to fight Al Qaida, and the United States committed to consulting closely with our NATO allies and partners on the way forward in Afghanistan. My administration strongly supports the diplomatic process that's underway and to bring an end to this war that is closing out 20 years. We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again provides a base for terrorist attacks against the United States and our partners and our interests. Our European partners have also stood with us to counter ISIS. Just this week, NATO Defense Ministers endorsed a significant expanded training-and-advisory mission in Iraq, which will be vital to the ongoing fight against ISIS. We cannot allow ISIS to reopen and regroup and threaten people in the Middle East, in Europe, in the United States, and elsewhere. And while the United States is undergoing a thorough review of our own force posture around the world, I've ordered the halting of withdrawal of American troops from Germany. I'm also lifting the cap imposed by the previous administration on the number of U.S. forces able to be based in Germany. I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined—determined—to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership. Earlier today, as was referenced, I participated in the first meeting of the G-7 leaders, where I spoke about the dire need to coordinate multilateral action to address COVID-19, the global economic crisis, and the accelerating climate crisis, and so much else. Achieving these goals is going to depend on a core strategic proposition, and that is: The United States must renew America's enduring advantages so that we can meet today's challenges from a position of strength. That means building back better our economic foundations, reclaiming our place in international institutions, lifting up our values at home and speaking out to defend them around the world, modernizing our military capabilities while leading with diplomacy, revitalizing America's network of alliances and partnerships that have made the world safer for all people. You know, I hope our fellow democracies are going to join us in this vital work. Our partnerships have endured and grown through the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They're not transactional. They're not extractive. They're built on a vision of a future where every voice matters, where the rights of all are protected and the rule of law is upheld. None of this has fully succeeded in this—none of us has fully succeeded in this division [vision]*. We continue to work toward it. And in so many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault. I have known for—I've known many of you for a long, long time, and you know that I speak my mind, so let me be straightforward with you all: We are in the midst of a fundamental debate about the future and direction of our world. We're at an inflection point between those who argue that, given all the challenges we face—from the fourth industrial revolution to a global pandemic—that autocracy is the best way forward, they argue, and those who understand that democracy is essential—essential—to meeting those challenges. Historians are going to examine and write about this moment as an inflection point, as I said. And I believe that—every ounce of my being—that democracy will and must prevail. We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission. Democracy doesn't happen by accident. We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it. We have to prove that our model isn't a relic of history, it's the single best way to revitalize the promise of our future. And if we work together with our democratic partners, with strength and confidence, I know we'll meet every challenge and outpace every challenger. You know, we must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China. How the United States, Europe, and Asia work together to secure the peace and defend our shared values and advance our prosperity across the Pacific will be among the most consequential efforts we undertake. Competition with China is going to be stiff. That's what I expect, and that's what I welcome, because I believe in the global system Europe and the United States, together with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, worked so hard to build over the last 70 years. We can own the race for the future. But to do so, we have to be clear eyed about the historic investments and partnerships that this will require. We have to protect—we have to protect—for space for innovation, for intellectual property, and the creative genius that thrives with the free exchange of ideas in open, democratic societies. We have to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared broadly and equitably, not just by a few. We have to push back against the Chinese Government's economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system. Everyone—everyone—must play by the same rules. U.S. and European companies are required to publicly disclose corporate governance—to corporate governance structures and abide by rules to deter corruption and monopolistic practices. Chinese companies should be held to the same standard. We must shape the rules that will govern the advance of technology and the norms of behavior in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology so that they are used to lift people up, not used to pin them down. We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression. You know, this is also how we're going to be able to meet the threat from Russia. The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance. Russian leaders want people to think that our system is more corrupt or as corrupt as theirs. But the world knows that isn't true, including Russians—Russia's own citizens. Putin seeks to weaken European—the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine the transatlantic unity and our resolve, because it's so much easier for the Kremlin to bully and threaten individual states than it is to negotiate with a strong and closely united transatlantic community. That's why standing up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine remains a vital concern for Europe and the United States. That's why addressing recklessness—Russian recklessness—and hacking into computer networks, in the United States and across Europe and the world, has become critical to protecting our collective security. The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China, but they're just as real. And it's not about pitting East against West. It's not about, we want a conflict. We want a future where all nations are able to freely determine their own path without a threat of violence or coercion. We cannot and must not return to the reflective [reflexive]* opposition and rigid blocs of the cold war. Competition must not lock out cooperation on issues that affect us all. For example, we must cooperate if we're going to defeat COVID-19 everywhere. My first Presidential national security memorandum focused on surging health and humanitarian responses to defeat COVID-19 and to better prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. Today I'm announcing that the United States is making a $2 billion pledge to COVAX, with the promise of an additional $2 billion to urge others to step up as well. Yet, even as we fight to get out of the teeth of this pandemic, the resurgence of Ebola in Africa is a stark reminder that we must simultaneously work to finally finance health security, strengthen global health systems, and create early warning systems to prevent, detect, and respond to future biological threats, because they will keep coming. We have to work together to strengthen and reform the World Health Organization. We need a U.N. system focused on biological threats that can move quickly to trigger action. Similarly, we can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change. This is a global, existential crisis, and we'll all suffer—we will all suffer—the consequences if we fail. We have to rapidly accelerate our commitments to aggressively curb our emissions and to hold one another accountable for meeting our goals and increasing our ambitions. That's why, as President, I immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement, and as of today, the United States is officially once again a party to the Paris Agreement, which we helped put together. On Earth Day, I will host a leaders' summit to help drive more ambitious actions among top emitters, including domestic climate action here in the United States. I am grateful—I'm grateful—for Europe's continued leadership on climate issues over the last 4 years. Together, we need to invest in the technological innovations that are going to power our clean energy futures and enable us to build clean energy solutions to global markets. The threat of nuclear proliferation also continues to require careful diplomacy and cooperation among us. We need transparency and communication to minimize the risk of strategic misunderstanding or mistakes. That's why the United States and Russia, notwithstanding other competition, extended the New START Treaty for an additional 4 [5]* years once I came—I was sworn in. That's why we have said we're prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5-plus-1 on Iran's nuclear program. We must also address Iran's destabilizing activities across the Middle East, and we're going to work in close cooperation with our European and other partners as we proceed. We'll also work together to lock down fissile and radiological material to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring or using them. Look, the range of challenges Europe and the United States must take on together is broad and complex. And I'm eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel, about her thoughts on the way forward together. So let me conclude with this: We cannot allow self-doubt to hinder our ability to engage each other or the larger world. The last 4 years have been hard. But Europe and the United States have to lead with confidence once more, with faith in our capacities, a commitment to our own renewal, with trust in one another and the ability of Europe and the United States to meet any challenge to secure our futures together. I know we can do this. We've done it before. Just yesterday—after a 7-month, 300-million mile journey—NASA successfully landed the Perseverance rover on Mars. It's on a mission of exploration, with elements contributed by our European partners, to seek evidence of the possibility of life beyond our planet and the mysteries of the universe. Over the next few years—""Percy"", as it's being called—the Perseverance will range and collect samples from the Red Planet and pile them up so another mission and rover, envisioned as a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency, will retrieve this trove of scientific wonders and bring it home to all of us. That's what we can do together. If our unbound capacity to carry us to Mars and back don't tell us anything else, they tell us we can meet any challenge we can face on Earth. We have everything we need. And I want you to know the United States will do—we'll do our part. We'll stand with you. We'll fight for our shared values. We'll meet the challenges of this new moment in history. America is back. So let's get together and demonstrate to our great, great grandchildren, when they read about us, that democracy—democracy—democracy functions and works, and together, there is nothing we can't do. So let's get working. Thank you all very much. Thank you, folks. [At this point, the President's concluded his virtual remarks and answered questions from reporters in the room as follows.] Severe Winter Storms in Texas  Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—the Texas Governor's request for a major disaster declaration? The President. Yes, I had a chance to speak with the Governor again last night, and I asked him whether he was about to ask for another effort to—because the circumstances Texas finds itself in—whether he was going to seek additional assistance. And we talked—I talked with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA—the Administrator. This afternoon I'm going to ask him to accelerate our response and request for, quote—it's a different declaration—a ""major disaster declaration"" so that we can get everything done that we need that's possible to get done with Federal Government help. FEMA is already there and providing support—generators, diesel fuel, water, blankets, and other supplies. But I've directed Health and Human Services—HHS—Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense to identify other resources—other resources that can provide and address the growing needs of the folks in Texas. And as a little bit along the lines I was just talking about, when any State—as I said when I ran, I'm going to be a President for all of America—all—red, blue; there's no red or blue. It's all about commitment to—the American people make to one another. And so we're going to sign that declaration once it's in front of me. And God willing, it will bring a lot of relief to a lot of Texans. And so thank you all so very much. The President's Travel Schedule  Q. Do you have any plans to visit Texas, Mr. President? The President. Say again. Q. Do you have any plans to visit Texas? The President. It depends. The answer is yes. The question is, I had planned on being in Texas the middle of next week, but what I don't want to be is a burden. When the President lands in any city in America, it creates—there's a—it has a long tail. And they're working like the devil to take care of their folks. If in fact it's concluded that I can do it without creating a burden for the folks on the ground while they're dealing with this crisis, I plan on going. But I'll—we'll know that—we'll make that decision probably the beginning of next week. Okay? Thank you."
"Feb 22, 2021",Remarks on Federal Aid to Small Businesses,"The President. Albert, thank you very much. Thank you not only for what you do for the—the credit you give me that I really don't deserve. This is a case of life and death. We're talking about people's lives. I want you to know that once we beat COVID, we're going to do everything we can to end cancer as we know it. I've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard/MIT scientist, to co-lead the Presidential Council of Advisers in Science and Technology and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists and address our most pressing needs. They'll be part of the administration's work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is DARPA in the Defense Department that develops the breakthroughs to protect our country. This administration is going to be guided by science: to save lives and to make lives better. And that's why I wanted to come here, Albert, to thank you and to thank all the workers here in Kalamazoo. And I'm here to thank my good friend, Governor Whitmer, and she has become a good and close friend. The Governor has been on the frontlines of this pandemic, as well, for a long time, and I think she's doing an incredible job under very difficult circumstances. And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States Senator and Debbie Stabenow. Gary is here. Gary has been a workhorse in making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone: It's about urgency, the urgency of the moment. So, Gary—thank you, Senator. Thank you for all you're doing. Last week, I toured the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I met world-class doctors, scientists, and researchers who were critical for discovering the vaccines in record time. I remember when we first started talking about this, asking Dr. Fauci and others. They said, ""Well, it could take up to several years, maybe as many as 6 or 8 years, to find a vaccine."" It's a miracle of science and the brilliant minds that we have around us. And now it's a second miracle—a miracle of manufacturing—to produce hundreds of millions of doses. Let me say that again: hundreds of millions of doses. I came here because I want the American people to understand the extraordinary—extraordinary—work that's being done to undertake the most difficult operational challenge this Nation has ever faced. And let me say parenthetically that it's not enough that we find cures for Americans. There needs to be cures that the world is able to take part of, because you can't build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out. On our tour, I met a few of your nearly 3,000 workers, Albert: experts managing ingredients that come in from different cities and States; experts handling 3-D modeling and artificial intelligence to ensure that every dose is properly crafted; experts ensuring a sterile environment so that each vial—each and every one—is safe and free of contaminants. All of this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then careful packaging and labeling. We walked by a freezer farm that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped. This is an incredibly complex process. And at every stop, safety is the utmost priority. The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and round-the-clock focus. Machinists operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world, working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies that, less than a year ago, were little more than theories and aspirations. And it takes a partnership, in our view, between the Federal Government and all of the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort. Just over 4 weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor—as my mother would say, ""God love him""—failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office. I directed Jeff Zients, my COVID-19 Response Coordinator, to lead my administration's work with the vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and to speed up delivery. Albert referenced it earlier, and I want to thank him for making it happen. Because we worked together, we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. And it doesn't mean that it will be in all Americans' arms, but enough vaccine will be available by that time. These orders allow facilities like this one to plan ahead, accelerate their production schedules. Here's what else we did: When we discovered that vaccine manufacturers weren't being prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fixed that problem and got them what they needed. We also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters, which has already helped increase vaccine production. In fact, on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn't have before; now, they do. And it's allowing them to ramp up production. And as we increase supply, we're carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more. And I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, I just toured, and that's—where it's being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does to actually make the vaccine. That's how fastidious they are. And listen to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-9 [COVID-19]* vaccines were safe. That's why, several weeks ago, I went through the rigorous scientific review. That's why I took my vaccine shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people that I know and believe it's safe. That's why Vice President Harris also received her shot publicly. We all know there is some history—there's some hesitancy about taking this vaccine. We all know there's a history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past. But if there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country, it's this: The vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it's your turn and available. That's how to beat this pandemic. And we're making progress. We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We're now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and, under the law, administer these shots. We've put new vaccinators in the field. These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—Defense Department, National Guard. We're literally lining up—we're lining up thousands of vaccinators, because it's one thing to have the vaccine, and it's very different to get it in someone's arms. We're also creating more places for people to get vaccinated. We've provided $3 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp up—and ramp up the existing ones that now—that are there. Right here in Michigan, with Governor Whitmer, FEMA has provided tens of millions of dollars to bolster the State's community vaccination centers, from the National Guard at the Expo Center here in Kalamazoo, to the TF—excuse me, the TCF Center in Detroit, to parking lots and churches across the State. We've worked with Governors in California, Texas, New York, and more to come, to stand up massive mass vaccine sites in stadiums that will be open 24/7 and arenas and community centers. It's an effort that's on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the states' use of their National Guards for pandemic efforts. And you suggested I do that a while ago, and I promised you I'd do it, and we did it. We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot. Here in Michigan, that's already more than 220 pharmacies, like Rite Aid and Meijers, in more than 130 Michigan cities. And that's just the beginning. It's only been 4 weeks. And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or a mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live, folks who don't have access to transportation to get the shots. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers—Federal community health centers—to reach those who are hit the hardest: Black, Latinos, Native Americans, and rural communities, which have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other group. Here in Michigan, we're already partnering with community health centers, serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the State. That's because you guys have pointed out where they were, why it was so important, and how we get to—as Gary talks about, get to—the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID. This is important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit get the care they deserve. We're now at a point where we've seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot. We're on track to surpass my commitment. You may remember when I said, ""In my first 100 days,"" just before I was inaugurated—which seemed like 100 days. But anyway, ""The first 100 days,"" before I was inaugurated, ""that we'd administer 100 million shots in my first 100 days."" But we're on the path to do that. We're averaging 1.7 million a day. Soon we'll be at 50 million, and I'm confident we'll exceed the number. But that's just the floor. We have to keep going. But despite the progress, we're still in the teeth of a pandemic. New strains are emerging. In a few days, we'll cross 500,000 Americans who will have died from COVID-19. Five hundred thousand. That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War II, over a 4-year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain. And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands, stay socially distanced, and mask up to help save lives. That's why, with the authority I have as President, I signed an Executive order—the only authority I have to require this—to require masking on all Federal property, all modes of travel like planes, trains, and buses. And we've been calling on Governors and mayors and local officials—Republicans and Democrats—to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions, just like Governor Whitmer has done here in Michigan. Look, I know it's inconvenient, but you're making a difference when you do it. Everything we do matters. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and yes, for your country. It's a patriotic duty. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis—the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9 trillion. So that's too much. Well, let me ask them: What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out? Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the Nation? Should we not invest $290 million [billion]* to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by while they get back to work? Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently? Should we not invest—and by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million [billion]* to help schools across the Nation open safely? Right now 24 million adults, 11 million children don't have enough food to eat. And unless you think I'm exaggerating, think of those scenes you've seen on the television with cars lined up, which seemed like miles, to wait to have someone put a box of food in their trunk. People never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own, they're in that circumstance. If we don't pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose [some of their]* nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program. Do we not invest $3 million—$3 billion to keep families from going hungry? One in five Americans are behind on their rent. One in ten are being on their mortgages. How many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring at the ceiling, saying: ""God, what is going to happen if I don't get my job, if I don't have my unemployment check? What's happened to me? I'm losing my health insurance. What do I do?"" This is the United States of America, for God's sake. We invest in people who are in need. Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads? I could go on, but you get the point. I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly. And I'm prepared to hear their ideas on how to make the package better and make it cheaper. I'm open to that. But we have to make clear who is helped and who is hurt. And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents. According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support. The vast majority of the American people—more than 70 percent of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including a majority of Republicans—want us to act, and act big and quickly and support the plan. Major economists—left, right, and center—say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs, in our people to prevent long-term economic damage to our Nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year. We've also been in constant contact with mayors and Governors, county officials, Members of Congress—both parties. Both parties. I've met with them in my office; I've met with them in—on the internet—on—Zooming on with them. Both parties in every State. And guess what? They agree we have to act now. I got a letter from more than 400 mayors, from big cities and small towns. They understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. That's why the American Rescue Plan puts 160 million—billion dollars into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites—everything that's needed to get vaccines into people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States has undertaken in peace time. It includes $4 billion for new manufacturing plants so we're ready to manufacture vaccines in the future and we don't have to wait. I'm going to close with what I said before: I'll always be straight with you. I said in my Inaugural I'll be—""give it to you straight from the shoulders,"" Roosevelt said. Because the American people can take the truth. They can handle anything. I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later. And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done. And I know this is personal: I walked in today, and I won't say who came up to me, but one of the people in this building came up to me and said, ""My father-in-law is dying from COVID."" I said, ""Can I call?"" He said: ""No. He couldn't take a call."" He says, ""Keep him in his prayers, please."" How many of you know somebody who's in real trouble or has passed? How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table? You've seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you're stepping up. You're saving lives here: lives of your loved ones, your neighbors, your fellow Americans. You're showing how this town, this State, this country takes care of our own, leaves nobody behind. We can do anything when we do it together. I believe we're on the road. And I promise you, I know we'll run into bumps. It's not going to be easy here to the end, but we're going to beat this. We're going to beat this. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Albert, thank you and your people for all you do. Pfizer Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you. Coronavirus Vaccine Distribution and Access/School Reopening Efforts  Q. President Biden, you've said that you think by the end of July is when we'll have enough vaccines for all Americans. But when do you think all Americans, or a majority, will have actually gotten the vaccine? The President. Well, all you've got to do is —do a little bit of the math. Getting the vaccine and having it available is not the same as putting it in someone's arms. This is going to be a continuous rolling effort. So we'll have had—we will have ordered, much of which will have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July. July 29 is the expected date. But that could change. Look at what's happening with the weather now, for example: It's slowing up the distribution right now. But I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than last. But I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don't know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done. We're going to have debates about whether or not—for example, I can't set nationally who gets in line when and first. That's a decision the States make. I can recommend. I can say what I've said—like, I'm the guy that said we should lower it to 65 years of age. I think 35 States have done that or more. I think that—for example, I think it's critically important to get our kids back to school. I think it's really important because of the psychological damage being done and the loss of time. A kid loses a semester when they're in fifth grade—it means they're not just a semester behind; they may be a year and a half behind. All of the difficulty. You were at that town meeting I had with that little girl who was worried that, you know, her mommy—told her mommy she worried maybe she's going to die. So there's a lot. I think it's important we get people back in school. There's a difference, for example, according to the science now, between kids between the ages of 3 and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb and/or communicate the disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old who congregate more together. It's harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school. We know certain things are necessary: social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing, and the possibility that staff, whether it's the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school or simply—you've heard me say this before—bus drivers. To open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers. We can't put kids packed in a bus, sitting next to one another. So we know the things that have to be done. The question is the order in which we do them is going to—determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services. But the reason I bother to bore you with that detail is to try to explain to the American people that this is a process, but we know now the fundamental basic elements. The fundamental basic elements are that, before you get the shot and after—if you get the shots and after—social distancing save lives, wearing masks saves lives, making sure that you wash your hands with hot water saves lives. This is not hyperbole. This is not a political statement. It's a reality. The science has demonstrated that. We also know that it's one thing to have a vaccine available. The problem was, how do you get into people's arms? There's not enough people to vaccinate. All the great hospitals in this State, and in my State, they can line up and give people, but they can't possibly handle the volume that is needed. So what do you do? You get more people qualified to give vaccinations. The quicker you can open up places and that people can come up and demonstrate they're on—on the pecking order and they're ready for their shot, and they're qualified—keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense, but you need people to do it. So we all know the basic things that have to happen. Now, we also know that there are things that intervene. Things happen. Weather. People get ill. People get confused. There's a lot of people who don't—aren't able. You know, I—you've heard me say before—you know, my little granddaughter can use that cell phone of hers to do more in about 12 seconds than I can do it in an hour. But a lot of people aren't able to, a lot of people who need the help. They say, ""Well, get online."" Well, they don't have the means to get online. They might not have, you know, the ability to get online, and they may not know how to do it. Talk about—everybody is—you know, most people are within 5 miles of a pharmacy. Well, if you're living alone and you're a 68-year-old woman, and you're in a minority neighborhood, and there's no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away. That's why we're leading now—and, Gary, you talked to me about it—getting mobile vans to go out. So we know the kinds of things that have to be done. But there has never ever, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequence—as consequential as we're trying to do. But we're getting it done. And as my mom would say, with the grace of God and the good will of neighbors, we're going to save a lot of lives. Thank you very much."
"Feb 22, 2021","Remarks on Remembering the 500,000 Americans Lost to COVID-19","Good afternoon. I just had an opportunity to catch up with two small-business owners I met on the road in the last couple weeks. And the first was a very entrepreneurial woman named Pilar Guzman Zavala, and she's from Florida, Miami. And Tim Eichinger, who is in Wisconsin. They have different businesses and live in different places, but both shared the same message with me when I spoke to them on the road, and that was, American small businesses are hurting and hurting badly, and they need help now. And it's in all of our interests to make sure they get the help now. Small businesses are the engines of our economic progress; they're the glue and the heart and soul of our communities. But they're getting crushed. Since the beginning of this pandemic, 400,000 small businesses have closed—400,000—and millions more are hanging by a thread. It's hurting Black, Latino, and Asian American communities the hardest. Walk down any Main Street and you see it: empty storefronts, goodbye signs hanging in the windows. Maybe it's the pizza place you used to take your family to dinner or the hardware store that always had the tool you needed. It's mom-and-pop shop that's sponsored by—that is supported by the community, and then, in turn, they support the community. They sponsor Little League teams; the barbershop with the first dollar bill that he or she earned is still taped to the wall, along with a picture of the kids who are now in college. These small businesses—not the ones with 500 employees, but these small businesses that, with a handful of folks, they are 90 percent of the businesses in America. But when the Paycheck Protection Program was passed, a lot of these mom-and-pop business just got muscled out of the way by bigger companies who jumped in front of the line. And I want to be clear: The Paycheck Protection Program is a bipartisan effort; Democrats and Republicans helped pass it. But Democrats and Republicans have also voiced concerns about improving it. With their input, that's what we're doing in our administration: improving it. In the last month, we've increased the share of funding for small businesses with fewer than 10 employees by nearly 60 percent. For businesses in rural communities, the share of funding is up nearly 30 percent since we came to office. And the share of funding distributed through banks that traditionally help minority-owned businesses is up more than 40 percent. And today I'm announcing additional changes to the PPP program that will make sure we look out for the mom-and-pop business even more than we already have. As I explained to Pilar and Tim—the two small-business people I spoke to—on Wednesday, the Small Business Administration is going to establish a 14-day exclusive PPP loan application period for businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees. People can go out and find how to get a hold of these loans. People can find out more at the SBA.gov. The Small Business Administration will also remove barriers that have stopped many businesses from being able to apply for these loans. For example, we're making it so that a student loan default or a non-fraud-related criminal record does not prohibit someone from applying for the program. We're also making it easy for those one-person businesses—like the home repair contractors; beauticians; small, independent retailers—to secure forgivable PPP loans. At the same time, we're increasing access by increasing oversight. I invite any inspector general in this program, with jurisdiction over this program, to closely look at these loans and report—publicly report—on any issues they uncover inconsistent with what I'm saying today. We will ensure every dollar is spent well. These changes will bring much-needed, long-overdue to—help to small businesses who really need help staying open, maintaining jobs, and making ends meet. And this is a starting point, not the ending point. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. It deals with the immediate crisis facing our small businesses. Now, critics say the plan is too big. Let me ask them a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut? What would you leave out? The American Rescue Plan targets $50 billion to support the hardest hit small businesses after this program expires at the end of March. Would you not help invest in them? Would you let them continue to go under? Would you leave them out again, like the previous administration did? One of the things I've heard again and again from small-business owners like Pilar and Tim is that knowing about support is one thing; being—gaining access to getting it is another. That's why we proposed $175 million to bring community organizations in to serve as ""navigators"" who will help them through this process of application. We would also establish a hotline, with help available in multiple languages so folks can pick up a phone and get the help they need to stay open and serve their community. Again, the critics: ""It's too big."" Should we not—should we stop spending money on them? Do we not want a return on investment that we make in these businesses to be able to stay open and thrive and pay back? Why would we not want to make sure small businesses, who lack teams of lawyers, bankers, and accountants, have an advocate—someone they can rely on—to direct them to help that's there for them now—will be there for them? The American Rescue Plan is a rescue plan for America's small businesses and America's mainstream businesses. And we need Congress to pass it right away. I'm grateful to the Senate and the House for moving so quickly. And I want to make it clear: I'm prepared to hear ideas about how to make the American Rescue Plan better and cheaper. But we have to make clear who we're helping and who it would hurt. I always try to help people like Tim and Pilar and all the country's small businesses, and families, the workers, the communities that depend on them to survive, recover, and grow. And it's my hope—my hope—that as Democrats and Republicans, who have backed the PPP program—that Democrats and Republicans will back the American Rescue Plan. The vast majority of the American people—more than 70 percent of the American people, including a majority of Republicans—want us to act based on all the polling data and act big and act quickly. Major economists—left, right, and center—here and abroad say we should focus on smart investments that can make jobs available and focus on the jobs and in the people to prevent long-term economic damage to our Nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by Wall Street's firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year. We've also been in constant contact with the mayors and Governors, county officials, Members of Congress of both parties in every State. That includes a letter, I might add, from more than 400 mayors from big and small cities, Democrat and Republican. They agree we have to act and act now. They understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. Getting our economy back means bringing our small businesses back. And that's what we're going to do. That's what I'm doing today. We're going to focus. The program ends at the end of March, but for the next 2 weeks, the only folks who can apply for that PPP money are businesses with fewer than 20 employees. Thank you very much."
"Feb 23, 2021",Remarks in a Virtual Roundtable Discussion With Black Essential Workers,"Each day, I receive a small card in my pocket that I carry with me in my schedule. It shows the number of Americans who have been infected by or died from COVID-19. Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone: 500,071 dead. That's more Americans who have died in one year in this pandemic than in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war combined. That's more lives lost to this virus than any other nation on Earth. But as we acknowledge the scale of this mass death in America, we remember each person and the life they lived. They're people we knew. They're people we feel like we knew. Read the obituaries and remembrances. The son who called his mom every night just to check in. The father's daughter who lit up his world. The best friend who was always there. The nurse—the nurse and nurses—but the nurse who made her patients want to live. I was in—just in Kalamazoo, Michigan, at the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility. There I met a man when I walked in whose father-in-law was dying of the virus. He was sad. I asked if I could call his father-in-law. He said his father-in-law was too sick to speak. But then, he said, but could I pray for him—could I pray for him. We all know someone—fellow Americans who lived lives of struggle, of purpose, and of hope; who talked late into the night about their dreams; who wore the uniform, born to serve; who loved, prayed, and always offered a hand. We often hear people described as ""ordinary Americans."" There's no such thing; there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They spanned generations, born in America, immigrated to America. But just like that, so many of them took final breath alone in America. As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. While we have been fighting this pandemic for so long, we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic or a blur or on the news. And we must do so to honor the dead, but equally important, care for the living and those they left behind. For the loved ones left behind, I know all too well; I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there, holding their hands. There's a look in your eye, and they slip away. That black hole in your chest, you feel like you're being sucked into it. The survivor's remorse. The anger. The questions of faith in your soul. For some of you, it's been a year, a month, a week, a day, even an hour. And I know that when you stare at that empty chair around the kitchen table, it brings it all back, no matter how long ago it happened, as if it just happened that moment you looked at that empty chair. The birthdays, the anniversaries, the holidays without them. And the everyday things—the small things, the tiny things—that you miss the most. That scent when you open the closet. That park you go by that you used to stroll in. That movie theater where you met. The morning coffee you shared together. The bend in his smile. The perfect pitch to her laugh. I received a letter from a daughter whose father died of COVID-19 on Easter Sunday last year. She and her children—his grandchildren—enter Lent this season, a season of reflection and renewal, with heavy hearts. Unable to properly mourn, she asked me in the letter, ""What was our loss among so many others?"" Well, that's what has been so cruel. So many of the rituals that help us cope, that help us honor those we loved, haven't been available to us. The final rites with family gathered around. The proper homegoing, showered with stories and love. Tribal leaders passing out [without]* the final traditions of sacred cultures on sacred lands. As a nation, we cannot—and we must—not let this go on. That's why the day before my Inauguration, at the COVID-19 Memorial at the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, I said to heal—to heal—we must remember. I know it's hard. I promise you, I know it's hard; I remember. But that's how you heal: You have to remember. And it's also important to do that as a nation. For those who have lost loved ones, this is what I know: They're never truly gone. They'll always be part of your heart. I know this as well—and it seems unbelievable, but I promise you—the day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye. It will come. I promise you. My prayer for you though is that day will come sooner rather than later. And that's when you know you're going to be okay—you're going to be okay. And for me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose. I don't know how many of you have lost someone a while ago and are wondering: ""Is he or she proud of me now? Is this what they want me to do?"" I know that's how I feel. And we can find purpose, purpose worthy of the lives they lived and worthy of the country we love. So today I ask all Americans to remember: Remember those we lost and those who are left behind. But as we remember—as we all remember, I also ask us to act. To remain vigilant, to stay socially distanced, to mask up, get vaccinated when it's your turn. We must end the politics and misinformation that's divided families, communities, and the country, and has cost too many lives already. It's not Democrats and Republicans who are dying from the virus. It's our fellow Americans. It's our neighbors and our friends, our mothers, our fathers, our sons, our daughters, husbands, wives. We have to fight this together, as one people, as the United States of America. That's the only way we're going to beat this virus, I promise you. The only way to spare more pain and more loss—the only way these millstones no longer mark our national mourning—these milestones, I should say—no longer mark our national mourning. Let this not be a story of how far we fell, but of how far we climbed back up. We can do this. For in this year of profound loss, we have seen profound courage from all of you on the frontlines. I know the stress, the trauma, the grief you carry. But you give us hope. You keep us going. You remind us that we do take care of our own. That we leave nobody behind. And that while we've been humbled, we have never given up. We are America. We can and will do this. In just a few minutes, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, will hold a moment of silence here in the White House: the People's House, your house. We ask you to join us to remember, so we can heal; to find purpose in the work ahead; to show that there is light in the darkness. This Nation will smile again. This Nation will know sunny days again. This Nation will know joy again. And as we do, we'll remember each person we've lost, the lives they lived, the loved ones they left behind. We will get through this, I promise you. But my heart aches for you—those of you who are going through it right now. May God bless you all, particularly those who have lost someone. God bless you."
"Feb 23, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"Domestic Policy Council Director Susan E. Rice. Good afternoon, and welcome. I'm Susan Rice, President Biden's Domestic Policy Adviser. It's great to be with you all and with President Biden. I help President Biden formulate and implement his domestic policy, and there's no greater priority than tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and rescuing our economy. We're here today to hear directly from you, frontline workers and first responders who are doing the very vital work and have borne the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic. You are heroes, and your service we honor. A disproportionate number of Black Americans serve as frontline workers and as first responders, putting yourselves at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. And one in four deaths from COVID-19 have been those of Black Americans. And so during this Black History Month, we wanted to say thank you, to lift up your voices and your service and your needs. The President's American Rescue Plan, if passed by Congress, will bring an end to this pandemic, and it will invest in you and your fellow frontline workers and all Americans so we can keep ourselves safe and rebuild our economy so that it works for everyone. Mr. President, joining us here today are Demetris Alfred—he goes by ""Al""—who is a—— The President. To me, he's ""Mr. President."" [Laughter] Director Rice. Al is a firefighter and EMT in St. Louis, Missouri. And we have Melanie Owens, a pharmacist in Chicago; Carmen Palmer, a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio; and Jeff Carter, a grocery store manager in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Thank you all so much for being here today and for sharing your stories with us. Mr. President, over to you. The President. Well, thanks for joining us, everyone. I—you know, I know I've met Al before. And, Al, thank you for all the help in the past, and we're going to try to help, now, you and the firefighters and the EMTs. And, Melanie, I understand you're the—what?—second- or third-generation pharmacist in your family? Is that right? Walgreens Pharmacy Manager Melanie Owens in Chicago, IL. Yes. The President. Well, that's pretty impressive. That's pretty impressive. And, Carmen, you do God's work. You're dealing with all those little kids and trying to figure out how you do it now and how you can safely open and how you can make it work. Kiddie Academy employee Carmen Palmer in Columbus, OH. [Inaudible]—it's a pleasure dealing with children. The President. Well, I tell you what: We need you badly. And, Jeff, you have too damn many Hy-Vees around the State. [Laughter] I mean, I tell you what—you know, I—it was always a debate whether I stop at a Hy-Vee or whether I find a frozen custard stand. But you know, that's what we did in Iowa. But all kidding aside, you all are—you're basically holding the country together. I'm not being facetious; I'm being deadly earnest. You can see the looks on people's faces when they walk into your drugstore and they stand at the counter and they ask for a prescription, can't you? You can see the fear in their eyes, as they—especially if they've gotten a—an unwelcome analysis, like two of your family members have, Al. And so what I want to do today is, I want you to know—there's that old bad joke, ""I'm from the Federal Government; I'm here to help."" But we are from the Federal Government, and we want to help. We want to help a lot. There hasn't been—most States—you're from four different States, and you're—I mean, we've got St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, and Cedar Rapids. And so—and every State, as you know, has a slightly different approach to how to deal with COVID right now. And we're trying to make sure they get all that they need, each of those States. And we're focusing, as the—as the former Ambassador said, that we're focusing on the—on the needs, particularly of the most left-behind community: the African American community. I mean, it really is across the board, but on this area specifically, as, I might add, are the Latino communities being left behind—not as much, but similarly—and Pacific Islanders. So there's a lot of work to do, and that's why we want to talk to you to see whether we're headed in the right direction. So I'm hear—I'm eager to hear what's on their mind, Susan, and see what you're thinking—what you think we should be doing. And now I know the guy from Iowa, Jeff, he'll ask any questions, because Iowans are so spoiled; they can ask every Presidential candidate: ""Come on. Can you come over here and sit down with me for a few minutes? I want to talk to you."" Right, Jeff? Hy-Vee Store Director Jeff Carter in Cedar Rapids, IA. Right. The President. So, you know—I mean, so—but all kidding aside, I'm anxious to hear what's on your mind, what you think we should be doing, and then maybe, in the process, ask a few questions and tell you the kinds of things we're doing to try to deal with what are, we think—I hope—are the problems of the people who are keeping us floating. You're the ones that keep us going. Not a joke. You are the ones that keep us going and kept the country going. You're carrying it on your back. And so thank you for what you've done so far. And we've got a lot more to do. Director Rice. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to begin by introducing our first speaker, Demetris ""Al"" Alfred. We'd actually like to hear from each of you about your experiences during COVID. But, Al, first I'd like to tell you—ask you to tell us about yourself. You're a 30-year firefighter and EMT in St. Louis. You're the president of your local union and president also of the Missouri State Council of Firefighters. You and your fellow workers have been through a great deal, and we'd love to hear your experiences over the last couple years. The President. Before you start, you heard that old expression: ""God made man, and then he made a few firefighters."" [Laughter] International Association of Fire Fighters, Paramedics, EMTs, and Dispatchers of St. Louis President Demetris ""Al"" Alfred. Yes, sir. Yes. Well, thank you. Thank you. And good afternoon, Ambassador Rice and Mr. President. It's a pleasure to be here and an honor to be able to speak to you. And good to see you again, Mr. President. The President. Good to see you. Mr. Alfred. We have met before, and I enjoy your company every time. Let me start out by saying: In St. Louis, the firefighters have had a tough time with COVID, going on calls. We've had to change up our direction on protocol a little bit, with masking up and 6-feet social distancing. We've even changed the protocol that when we go on medical runs and calls, people trapped in a house, and even fires—we approach them a little bit different. We have to wear face masks. [Mr. Alfred continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] We just would like the support from Federal Government, local, and State to keep us afloat so we can have the equipment and things to keep us going to do our job. And we'll appreciate everything you guys can do for us. The President. Al, let me ask you: If you had to identify the one thing—you could wave a wand—the one thing that could help your women and men and the firefighters and EMTs, what do you need the most? Mr. Alfred. We would like to make certain that we could get the funding down to the local level and to the fire departments in particular, so, like I said, we can still purchase the PPE to sustain us, to get our equipment, and things like that. And most importantly, we'd like to get support so we wouldn't have the budget cuts or have to endure any pay cuts or layoffs. That's a big worry, because like I said, we respond to everything; we show up ready to go, very resourceful; and we adapt very well. But then, after things are over, once the crisis has passed, it appears that sometimes the local government or management—however you want to look at it—find that the department may be easy to cut because the crisis is over. And that's our—that's one of our biggest concerns. So if you ask me if I had a major wand—a magic wand, I would say that I'd wave that wand to make sure that we get the proper funding to sustain our jobs so we can respond and help the citizens of our community. The President. Well, that's what we do in this legislation we put together. And I hope to God it's going to pass. We provide for resources—$350 billion for emergency funding for State, local, and territorial governments. Now, we've got 340 million people in America. We've got a big country. And so what's happened is, a lot of States have decided that they—because they have to balance their budgets—they can't continue to spend the same amount of revenue they were spending before. And what's happening is a lot of—everything from firefighters to schoolteachers to a whole range of people are being laid off. We're short 6,000 teachers, firefighters. And the only thing I know—working with your outfit, Al, for so long—is that the only thing keeps firefighters safe is more firefighters. Literally. Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir. The President. Literally. And so you're being cut. We also find—provide for $160 billion for supplies. And that would be everything from, you know, making sure we can scale vaccine distribution and testing, make sure everybody can get in there and have an opportunity to get the test to EMTs and firefighters. When we get that done, we're going to have one less crisis you have to deal with. Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir. The President. But look, the funds we're talking about are designed to keep teachers and school workers on the job, including childcare; invest in personal protective equipment. I understand, from the story I was told, that you have the personal protective equipment in St. Louis, but they don't have it in Kansas City—of the firefighters. Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir. The President. And also to reduce, you know, any—just increase capacity across the board. So, you know, we owe you a lot. My family owes you a particularly lot. You literally—as you know, when we talked, you saved my life. The EMTs in my State saved my life. Got me down to a hospital in time to save my life. And my boys; you saved their lives too, with the ""jaws of life"" much earlier. So we owe you big. But what I want to do is make sure you—I get more specific with you and find out that—you know, whether or not you have access to get in line. Last thing: States set the priorities for who gets the vaccine. We have now gone from having a shortage of vaccines to, by the end of July, we'll have over 600 million doses of vaccine, enough to take care of everybody in the country. And we're moving as the—as Ms. Owens knows, we're moving to make sure that drugstores, pharmacies are going to be able to be a place—just like for flu shots—you can go. We've just gone from—because we find that that's more accessible to an awful lot of folks who are—don't have the means to travel very far, don't have the access to get to where they need to go. And they're used to their pharmacy, and they know their pharmacist, and they can get a shot. And we've gone from this week—last week, 1 million doses to pharmacies to 2 million this week. So, with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors, we're going to be able to significantly increase that. And, Carmen, I'm pushing really hard for—I mean this sincerely—for daycares to be able to open, and you need financial help to open. You can't just open just straight up. And—but we'll talk about that a little bit as we go on. I don't want to take too much time at the front end here. So look, Al, just—you know, don't be shy about letting us know what you need. And what you need in Missouri is not fundamentally different than what people need in Kansas and people need in Iowa and people need in Illinois, et cetera. So we ought to talk some more. Okay? Mr. Alfred. Absolutely, Mr. President. And you know our favorite statement: We have your back. The President. You have, man. As one of your guys said, ""You have my back so much, you're breaking my shoulders,"" pushing me. [Laughter] Mr. Alfred. [Laughter] That's all right. The President. Anyway, thank you, Al. Director Rice. Well, Mr. President, next I'd like to introduce Melanie Owens. Melanie, as you know, is a pharmacist on the South Side of Chicago. Melanie actually contracted COVID herself last March and has now been vaccinated. And she's been administering vaccines to people in her community. Melanie, please give us a sense of your story. Ms. Owens. Hi, Mr. President. And thank you very much, Ambassador Rice. It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you. And thank you for allowing me to share a small part of my story. As she said, I am a pharmacist in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago—a pharmacy manager. And I began my career with Walgreens nearly 20 years ago, and it was the opportunity to help care for others in our communities that helped me become a pharmacist. And it didn't hurt that both of my parents are pharmacists as well. I also have a sister who is a nurse, and my brother-in-law is an engineer for the fire department. So we're all frontline workers. [Ms. Owens continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] So, President Biden, please keep rolling out the vaccine because it is helping to keep people alive and safe. So with that, I just want to say thank you again for this opportunity. I never thought I'd be able to speak directly with the President of the United States and especially on Zoom. [Laughter] So thank you. Thank you so much for that. The President. Well, thank you, Melanie. Look, let me ask you a couple questions. You're in the South Side of Chicago; that's where my kids' grandparents are from. Ms. Owens. Awesome. The President. And they're—and you know, people are—you know, they don't have a whole lot of money. And a lot of people don't—and it's an older population these days. Ms. Owens. Yes. The President. And one of the things that I've observed is that there is a reluctance to—if they don't know how to get online with you—a lot of people don't know how to use that—they may not have a cell phone; they may not have the ability to know how to pick the phone up and get online. They just—and so, they're reluctant. And what I found is—from the days when my dad was raising me—that sometimes people, when they don't know what to do, they're embarrassed to acknowledge they don't know how to do it. They don't know how to get it done. So how important do you think it is—what—and one more piece of this. We also know, because of the way American medicine has taken advantage of African Americans for experimentation over the last hundred years, that there's a real reluctance that still exists in the African American community to get the vaccination, even if it's available. And my—I've been pleading with people, ""Get it."" If you have a chance, get it. It will save not only your life potentially, but it will save your family a little bit. So tell me about what you've sensed. I can tell you have a feel for this. Tell me—no, I really mean it. Tell me what you sense from your patients who come in to get the shot. Is it—I don't think they're afraid of a needle. It's not like, ""Oh, a needle."" But are they reluctant to say—to deal with it? Or is it because you're an African American woman they respect, does that make it easier for them to be able to take the—— Ms. Owens. So I will say that my customer base, for the most part, is very excited. We haven't had many people come discussing whether or not we would get it ourselves or, you know, should they get it. It's more when can they get it. I was more reluctant than most people—[laughter]—most of my customers to get it, actually. But then, you know, it just kind of felt like an obligation when I started to go to long-term care facilities. You know, I'm here to protect them, so I needed it. And you know, just listening to my parents, who are in their seventies, who were so eager to get it, and I was happy to be able to help them get it. You know, it just—it helped to change my mind. And I also had some administrative staff at the first long-term-care facility that I went to change their mind based on me changing mine, at that moment, to get it. So, I mean, I think it's just—you can be fearful. You know, you can have questions. But you know, do your due diligence and figure out what is best for you. And you know, like I said earlier, this is going—if this is a part of or a major key of what's going to help us move past this and then go back to being able to live normally, I feel like we should do it. You know, it's no harm in it. The President. Well, we've been able to increase the supply to the States, in just in the month we've been here, by 57 percent. So they're getting 57-percent more vaccine than they did before. And we're going to—God willing, we're going to be in a position where we can significantly increase that as well. So that—and the other thing is, we have set up—and we made another Federal decision, saying that we were going to use community health facilities, which usually take care of the folks who are the most in need—— Ms. Owens. Yes. The President. ——and because they know where—I'm not being facetious when I say this—they know where the people sleeping under the bridge are. They know where people who are really in real dire straits, who they're going out to get them, to get them vaccinated. And so we're hoping that this helps. In addition, you know, one of the things we're going to be able to do is: Part of this investment is $20 billion in the National Vaccination Program. As you know, the funding helps deploy community vaccinators and vaccination centers. You're one of them. You're in the community. That's why—but some of the Governors were not sure that's the way to go, that we—and I'm not picking on any Governor. I really mean it. They didn't understand why we made the independent decision to send vaccine directly to 600-and-some—or 600—67 different drug chains or drugstores out there—why we send it directly to them. And they weren't sure why we were sending directly to childcare facilities. That's what we're going to try to do now. And so—because they thought they could better decide where to use it. But I am determined to make sure we service the communities that are the ones that are the most victimized by—""victimized,"" wrong word; most affected by—most affected by the COVID virus when they get it and the consequences of it. But I thank you for all you do—and I really mean it—and for going to those—into those—those long-term care facilities and helping there as well. So thank you very much. Ms. Owens. Thank you. Director Rice. Thank you, Melanie. Mr. President, our third participant, as you know, is Carmen Palmer. Carmen is a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio. But—I say ""childcare worker,"" but that really doesn't do it justice. She does almost everything there is to do. The President. That's what I read. Director Rice. [Laughter] She runs a food program at the childcare center. She's a substitute teacher. She's a bus driver when needed. And she's also the mother of two of her own young children. So, Carmen, we'd love to hear your story. The President. You obviously have a lot of spare time, Carmen. [Laughter] Ms. Palmer. Of course. I just, you know, wanted to tell you, you know, thank you, President Biden and Ambassador Rice, for, you know, speaking with me and giving me this opportunity. I do appreciate that. Again, I'm Carmen Palmer. You know, I'm born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. I grew up in foster care. And after graduating high school, that's when I decided, you know, for a better environment, and I moved to Ohio. And that's where I found my home here at Kiddie Academy. I've been working here 5 years, and as Ambassador Rice mentioned, my two children both attend the childcare facility. [Ms. Palmer continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] Our enrollment is down, and we are seeing less of our families because of the pandemic. They're not working, and, you know, they're losing their jobs. And I'm just really grateful that I'm able to still work, you know, during the pandemic, and that's important to me to keep an employment. So—— Director Rice. Thank you, Carmen. The President. Well, Carmen, look, you know, we—this legislation, which we think is going to pass, is going to help childcare providers by allowing you to pay the rent; pay your utilities; your payroll, if there is one beyond you—as a loan; as well as increased costs associated with the pandemic. And those costs include PPE; you mentioned ventilation—paying for ventilation improvement; small group sizes; modifications to make physical environment inside safer by providing more dividers. We're also temporarily going to increase the Child Care Tax Credit. Right now, if you make over a certain amount of money, you will get a tax credit of 2,000 bucks now. We're going to raise that to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for a child under the age of 6 and make it refundable, which is the big deal. Because if you're not making a lot of money and not paying taxes—you may have two or three kids—you don't get any help at all. But now what will happen is, if this passes, they will get a refundable credit for each child, if they're under 6—a $3,600 check from the Federal Government. And the same thing for the $2,000 and so on. So they say we'll cut—if we get this done, it will cut child poverty in half. But in addition to that, it will provide those parents with access to not only your daycare center, but others across the country to be able to afford it. And we're also making sure that we provide money for folks who are about to be thrown out of their homes, or you know, there's millions of people out there who can't pay the rent. And so we've deferred any cost to have to pay the rent while this pandemic is going on, because otherwise, you'd just have—we'd be vastly increasing the homeless population, which makes no sense. And so, you know, we know how important early childhood education and a child's development is. And to get through this crisis, I think we need to be sure childcare providers have the funding they need to stay afloat. And you mentioned something, Carmen, that is really important. You know, the—most of these kids you've been taking care of, if they were going to kindergarten or preschool, they'd be getting a free lunch program. Ms. Palmer. Yes. The President. Well, you know—well, we've got to increase the amount of money available for what used to be called the ""food stamp program,"" but it's not now. As—and—but we got to make more—make it available. Because did you ever think you'd see in your—anyone in your hometown where you'd see miles of cars lined up in multiple lanes, waiting for one box of food? Ms. Palmer. No. The President. This is United States of America, for God's sake. And the idea there is that much food insecurity is just not right. So what—I believe if we get this bill passed—which we're not going to pass by a lot, but we're optimistic we're going to make some real changes. And the childcare centers are at risk of closing all around the country. And what impact would it have—and the last question I'll ask—if you had to shut down, what do you think it would do to the children and the parents that you—that now are your clients? Ms. Palmer. I mean, it will be—it would have a tremendous impact on our families. Our families are, you know, telling us now that they can't work, and it's definitely hard to find childcare if you don't have any employment. The President. Yes. Ms. Palmer. And even me, as myself, I honestly wouldn't know what I could do if I didn't have childcare so I could go to work. Because I have no family here; all my family is back home in Michigan. The President. Yes. Okay, kiddo, keep doing what you're doing. You're—— Ms. Palmer. Thank you. The President. You're really—as my mom would say, you're doing God's work, kid. Ms. Palmer. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President. Director Rice. Mr. President, Carmen is also the only one with young kids in school. And I thought it might be worth just asking her to say a few words about how her kids have fared in the pandemic with the virtual schooling and then, now, hybrid schooling. The President. Are you able to take them to the daycare for the hybrid school? Ms. Palmer. Yes. Yes, I am. I actually made the joke with Ambassador Rice yesterday on saying, like: ""I really fear for my youngest son. He's 7. He's a thumb sucker, and I for sure knew he was going to get COVID."" Because I'm like, ""You just keep—put your hands in your mouth."" But—so I—they—I put them in—enrolled them in virtual, and then my oldest daughter, she—her grades—you know, she started to struggle. So I was, like, ""Okay, you needed the help."" So I, you know, switched her over to hybrid. So on Mondays and Tuesdays, they attend school to get, like, the help they need—that one-on-one. And then, Wednesdays and Thursdays and Fridays, they attend the daycare. And our, you know, teachers there are willing to, you know, help assist them, you know, with their hybrid learning. But you know, sometimes—you know, not even just my kids, but all the kids as well are dealing with their social and emotional needs of social distancing and really can't go anywhere but just school and home. So we have to, you know, deal with those aspects of the kids as well. The President. Well, an awful lot of children, as well as adults, are going through some real—they need some help in terms of depression and mental problems. I mean, you know, they're just—we're worried about their—they're just so off. They don't know exactly what's going on, and it has real impacts. And that's why we got to get them back into school; that's why we have to open up these schools. And by the way, the other—a lot of you out there are struggling just to make ends meet even if you have a job, and—but we're going to make sure you get that extra $1,400 check during the pandemic that both parties had said they support it. Even the past President said he strongly supported it. We just got to get it done now. But it will make a difference and give you some—just, literally, some breathing room just to be able to—just a little breathing room. That's what we need to give people right now. Because everybody in this shot, in this circumstance that is being hurt, it's through no fault of their own. It's not their fault that the pandemic started. Well, thank you. Ms. Palmer. Oh, you're welcome, Mr. President. Thank you. Director Rice. Mr. President, last but by no means least, I wanted to introduce Jeff Carter. Jeff is the district store manager of two Hy-Vee grocery stores in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Jeff, we'd love to hear your story too. Mr. Carter. Thank you very much, Mr. President and Ambassador Rice. I really appreciate the opportunity that I've been given to speak with you and, kind of, tell my story a little bit. As I said, my name is Jeff Carter. I am married to my wife Kim Carter. We've been married for about 25 years. I do have an older son; his name is Mason. He works as a finance officer in one of the major car dealerships here in Cedar Rapids. I work for Hy-Vee, and Hy-Vee is a grocery store chain in—we have stores in Iowa. And, as you mentioned, Mr. President, we have too many stores in Iowa, but we also have stores in Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. So we are—— The President. I know. I was teasing you. [Laughter] Mr. Carter. [Laughter] I know. But it's—we're a great company, and I really have appreciated the opportunity that I have to work for them. We employ over 88,000 employees. And during this past year, the pandemic has really challenged us to not only focus on service to our customers and our employees, but also safety. You know, we really had to shift our focus rapidly on how we take care of our customers, how we make sure that they are safe when they come into stores. [Mr. Carter continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] And through all that, you know, many of our employees—you know, some were a little bit, you know, concerned about going to work because they had, you know, maybe family members at home that had underlying health conditions that might put them at risk of catching the virus and possibly falling very sick or, worse, possibly death. But they still came to work to help serve our customers and do their job. On top of that, in Cedar Rapids, on August 10, we had a major weather event called ""derecho"" that rolled through our city. The President. That was amazing. Mr. Carter. It was an amazing event that I had never, ever witnessed—that I'd never even heard the word ""derecho"" prior to that. We had winds of up to 120 miles an hour go through and destroy property and trees. Many trees were lost, and we're—in fact, they actually have a campaign right now where we are—as Hy-Vee, we are getting thousands of trees into the city and surrounding areas—that we can replace those trees that were lost. [Mr. Carter continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] And once again, I'm very—I very much appreciate this opportunity. It's like a dream come true, something I'll cherish for the rest of my life. And I'll probably watch this video over and over again. [Laughter] So thank you very much. The President. Well, Jeff, it's an honor for the Ambassador and I to be—and me, to be able to talk you. Look, one of the things that the Ambassador and I made the decision early on, to quote Franklin Roosevelt, I'm going to give it to you ""straight from the shoulder."" I'm not going to play games. I'll tell you when we do it right, and I'll tell you when we screwed up and tell you we'll take responsibility. That's what I think all of you are doing. You're giving this straight to the people you're working with and to the people you're trying to help. And we spent much too much time ignoring this. One of the things you've all mentioned is the PPE—the protective gear—and social distancing. And I know that that Melanie knows this, as a pharmacist, and all of you know it from your experience, that the way—we can save—we could have saved literally an awful lot of lives if people had listened. We turned wearing masks into a political statement—if you were for this thing, you'd wear it; if you're for somebody else, you didn't wear it—when, in fact, it's just plain, basic science. Science. Social distancing, so you're not coughing on one another—the particles. The ventilation you talked about, Carmen, makes a difference in community centers and the like. And so there's so many things that we can do that are just within our own power. We're probably going to be sending out an awful lot of masks around the country, very shortly—millions of them. But the point is that you all—interesting, without my asking you—talked about the need to social distance. It's kind of hard to social distance in a fire truck. It's kind of hard to social distance in a—with an EMT in the back of a wagon. But you all know it's important. And so I hope you'll continue. I had said, when I got elected, that in my first 100 days, I'd guarantee people we'd get at least 100 million shots in people's arms—100 million shots in people's arms. And 30 days in, we're about 40 percent of the way there. And what are we at? Forty-seven—— Director Rice. Almost 50 million, not quite. The President. Almost 50 million right now. And we said we're going to do a million shots a day. One of the things that you and Melanie know is that we had to get vaccinators. It's one thing to get a vaccine delivered; it's another thing to get it out of that vial, into a needle, and into somebody's arm. And so we worked very hard. We've probably gotten another—it's close to 4,000 people who give vaccinations, from National Guard, to the Defense Department, to others, and to units within commercial operations that can have people who can do the vaccination. I've signed an Executive order allowing former retired doctors and nurses to be able to come back and give vaccinations. And so we're going to beat this thing because of folks like you. And to the extent you can continue to have your constituencies—and they're all different—is to make sure that they understand that social distancing matters, washing your hands matters, and the whole idea. And I don't have to tell you that, Al. You know, you had two kids affected, right? Mr. Alfred. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. They're back doing pretty good. We're blessed. The President. Well, thank God. So, but one of the things that—you know, again, I'm going to go back to the whole question of equity. What we're trying to do—my team and I—is get people who in fact have been most hurt by this pandemic to places where they are comfortable, where they have comfort in going. They don't feel like they are—they're not intimidated by the circumstance. And they're usually—they're used to going to the grocery store. They're used to going to their—to their drugstore or pharmacy. They're used to doing those things. But we also are trying to get out mobile units into communities—not only inner city, but rural communities—that don't have as much access. You know, I guess, they tell me the statistic is that the vast majority of the American people live within 5 miles of a pharmacy. Well, the point is that that may be case, but if you're an older person living by yourself, you don't have a vehicle, and there's no public transportation, it's awful hard to get to that pharmacy. So we're working out ways now to provide mobile transportation—literally vans going into communities—and people, you know, getting shots that are being administered by people who people tend to trust. So I'm glad—I can't tell you how much difference you're making. We've met with people all over the country via this means. And I think there's a growing awareness that, you know, injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you. [Laughter] And I'm being serious—I mean, think about it: all the ridiculous things. And there is online still—there are those who are the—you know, the vaccine—— Director Rice. Deniers. Yes. The President. ——deniers, and telling all these stories about what's—that aren't true. So I really appreciate you and your colleagues across the country who are continuing to push and say: ""No. If you can get a vaccine, get it. And if you can get it, get it as quickly as you can. Socially distance."" We're now doing a study. The COVID team, they're studying whether or not once you've had the vaccine and you've had it for the better part of several weeks—the last shot what can you do and not do, in terms of being sure that you are safe? Do you still wear a mask? Do you still socially distance, et cetera? And so it's all—we're an administration that thinks science matters—science matters—and it has to be available to the poorest among us and those who are most hurt by this COVID crisis across the board. And that's what we're doing. Do you have any questions for me? Seriously, you can ask me anything you'd like. I can tell Carmen has a good question. I don't know. She's not sure. ""Should I really ask him that?"" [Laughter] I don't know. You can ask me anything you want. I'm just Joe, okay? So fire away. Do you have a question? Ms. Palmer. When are you coming to see us in Columbus? The President. Well, I'm going to be back in Columbus. I was in Columbus—actually, now it's about literally 35 days or so ago. I came through in a whistle stop, in a train, when I was trying to get the nomination, when I was trying to win the election. But I like Columbus. And I'm a Democrat, but I think your Governor is doing a pretty decent job of trying to get things going. I'm—you know, I don't think there's anything political about this. Some folks are just stepping up, and he's stepped up in my—my impression. We disagree on things. We used to serve together. I like him. But it's not a—I just think this is about—it's about the science. But when I come back, you know, if you see me, you better not say, ""Joe, who?"" Okay? [Laughter] ""Who is that guy? Joe, who? What was that guy's name?"" Ms. Palmer. [Inaudible]—stop by the Academy. The President. [Laughter] Well, I'll you what, I'd like—I hope I can be—get to the point where that's happened. Now, the one thing I get most asked is when it's going to go back to normal. The honest to God truth is, I can't tell you that. But most experts tell you that things are going to be—continue to change and change somewhat rapidly. I think you're going to see that, next fall, it's going to be different than last fall. I think you're going to see that we're going to be going into the Christmas season better than we were. Whether it's back to complete normal, I don't know. But we're going to beat this. I promise you we are going to, together, beat this. And I think that, I—you know, but the idea that over 500—I think it's—I have a card. I carry a card with me every day and—with the total number of folks who have been affected by the—as of yesterday, there are 500,071 people who have died from this—500. That's more people that died in World War I, World War II, and Vietnam combined, in a year—in a year. But look, when the American people set their minds to something, there's nothing—nothing—we've been unable to do if we do it together. So with your help—and there's so darn many—you know, we—look—look at all the stuff that's, I don't know, bad or disappointing out there, but there's so darn many good, decent, honorable people in this country, and they want to get it done right. And so, in the meantime, make me one promise: You all take care of yourselves. We need you, for real. We need you, for real, okay? Director Rice. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all. Thank you for your time and your sharing your thoughts. It's wonderful to be with you. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. And you have the number. You can call us anytime. I really mean it. Not a joke. Director Rice. They know how to find me now, so—— The President. Yes, I know. [Laughter] Mr. Carter. We have your e-mail, I think. The President. Believe me. She knows how to find me. Director Rice. [Laughter] The President. ""Joe, where are you? Come here."" Director Rice. ""Mr. President,"" not ""Joe."" The President. Well, we used to be ""Joe."" Director Rice. Oh, okay. The President. Still—""Joe"" is still good. All right, thank you. Director Rice. Thanks, everybody. Take care. Participants. Thank you. Director Rice. Stay well. The President. Appreciate it."
"Feb 23, 2021",Remarks to Members of the Press With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"President Biden. Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you. And I wish I could reciprocate the hospitality you gave me when I visited Ottawa as Vice President in 2016. The sooner we get this pandemic under control, the better. And I look forward to seeing you in person in the future. As you know, to state the obvious—we had a private talk about this a little while ago—the United States has no closer friend—no closer friend—than Canada. That's why you were my first call as President, my first bilateral meeting. And of course, my Vice President spent some time living up in Montreal for high school. And so our channel of communication is—are wide open. As you know, we have a robust agenda today. And we're all best served when the United States and Canada work together and lead together in close coordination on a full range of issues we're going to discuss: COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, refugees and migration, fighting for our democratic values on a global stage, and strengthening our own democracies at home. We spoke about this at the G-7, but it's worth saying again: I believe the leaders of the major democracies, we have—as leaders of the major democracies, we have a responsibility to prove that democracy can still deliver for our people. There are a lot of leaders around the world who are trying to make the argument autocracy works better. Empowering the full participation of our people, expanding opportunity and equity for everybody, ensuring the benefits of growth are shared broadly: that's how we're going to win the battle for the future. So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your partnership and your enduring commitment to the U.S.-China relationship—U.S.-Canadian relationship. We're going to talk about China. And I'm looking forward to a very productive discussion. The floor is yours, Mr. Prime Minister. [At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke via videoconference from Ottawa, Canada.] Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's so good to see you, Joe. And it's such a great opportunity for us to sit down and talk not just about this extraordinary friendship between our two countries, but all the work we have to do together to get through COVID, but also to keep making sure we're pulling our weight around the world and making the world a better and safer place for everyone, not just with this pandemic, but with everything else as well. It's a real pleasure to be able to see you today alongside Vice President Harris. I'm glad to be joined here by our Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and our Foreign Minister, Marc Garneau, whose birthday it is today. So it's a special celebration for him. Lots of things to talk about. Obviously, COVID and how we're going to keep our citizens safe is top of mind. But we're also going to dig into the recovery; how we move forward on creating good jobs for Canadians and Americans; strengthening the middle class; helping those working hard to join it. As we move forward, there's a lot to rebuild. We're also going to talk about climate change. And thank you again for stepping up in such a big way on tackling climate change. U.S. leadership has been sorely missed over the past years. And I have to say, as we're preparing the joint rollout and communiqué from this one, it's nice when the Americans are not pulling out all references to climate change and, instead, adding them in. So we're really excited to be working with you on that. Lots more to do. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.] I'm really looking forward to engaging with you all on these issues over the coming hours, but especially looking forward to getting to know your whole team as well. Vice President Harris, it's great to see you here. I'll turn it over to you now. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. It is good to see you. It was good to speak to you on the 1st of February. And as the President said, I spent many of my teenage years living in Montreal when my mother was teaching at McGill University and doing her research at the Jewish General Hospital there. So I have fond memories of my time in Montreal, and it certainly left me with a lasting impression about how much our two countries have in common in terms of shared values and priorities. And as the President has said, we have a lot to do, each of us. And together we can do a lot of it in addressing COVID; in addressing the impact of the pandemic on our countries; looking at where we have possibilities to work together, not only in terms of the public health and economic struggles of our country, but also what we have in terms of shared values around addressing the challenges of climate change. We look forward to working with you on that and many others. We are neighbors. We are friends, as a country. And the challenges that we face not only are, as we have said, about COVID and climate change; also, as the President will talk about and has mentioned, our challenges in terms of China and Russia and what we can do in terms of working together on that and working together in terms of strengthening and modernizing the U.N. and WTO. So we look forward to working with you. It is good to speak with you. And I'll now turn it over to Deputy Prime Minister Freeland. And I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you. [Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland spoke via videoconference from Ottawa, Canada.] Deputy Prime Minister Freeland. Well, Madam Vice President, it gives me such pleasure to address that term directly to you. And I have to tell you, your election has been such an inspiration for women and girls across Canada, especially for Black women and girls and for South Asian women and girls. So many of them have told me that directly. I am so looking forward to working with you and your administration on conquering COVID, on working together to be sure our economies can come roaring back. I couldn't agree more with what the President says, that we have a real responsibility now—all of us—to show that democracy can deliver for our people: for Canadians, for Americans, and for the whole world. And with the friendship of everyone in this room, in that virtual room, I am pretty confident we're going to do it. [Deputy Prime Minister Freeland spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] Madam Vice President, we are very proud of you, and all the women and girls in Canada are very proud of you, of course. And I do hope that once COVID is over, we will be able to meet in person. And indeed, French—I am, myself, an English speaker, and French is a difficult language to learn, but I do believe that is well worth it. Vice President Harris. Moi aussi. Merci beaucoup. [Laughter] President Biden. Well, before we go on, I want to make sure you know Antony Blinken, our Secretary of State, sitting here on the right. And the fellow down here on the right hand side is a guy named Jake Sullivan, and he's the National Security Adviser. And the National Security Council Senior Director for Western Hemisphere, Juan Gonzalez, who usually speaks Spanish to me, which I have trouble with as well. I told you, Mr. Prime Minister, I took 5 years of French in school and college as well. And when I—every time I tried to speak it, I'd make such a fool of myself, I stopped trying. At least when I try Spanish and I make a fool of myself, they laugh with me. At any rate, thank you very much. And the press is about to leave the room here, and we can get to business."
"Feb 24, 2021",Remarks During a Meeting With Members of Congress on Strengthening United States Supply Chains,"[President Biden spoke virtually from the White House.] President Biden. Good evening, everyone. Justin, we had good meetings. Prime Minister Trudeau and I just concluded a very productive bilateral meeting, the first of what I'm sure will be many close and cooperative sessions. One of our last foreign trips I made was—as Vice President was to visit the Prime Minister in Ottawa. And today we were able to drive right into the many vital issues of importance for both our nations. For both our nations, getting COVID under control at home and around the world is the immediate priority. And we committed to work together to help prevent future biological threats by strengthening the World Health Organization, supporting our bold targets under the Global Health Security Agenda, cooperating on the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons [and Materials]* of Mass Destruction, and engaging in—other multilateral institutions to promote transparency, build capacity, and strengthening global norms. We also agreed to work in close cooperation to strengthen the supply chain security and resilience and to ensure that Canada and the United States are driving a robust economic recovery that benefits everyone, not just those at the top. That's especially important because we know that this pandemic is not affecting everyone the same way. Women are dropping out of work—in the workforce at alarming rates. Black, Latino, and Native are also—and other minority communities are particularly hard hit. We also agreed to work together on a inclusive recovery, using the tools available to us through the small and medium enterprise chapter of our trade agreement to support women- and minority-owned businesses. And we also doubled down on our efforts to tackle climate change. It was really, really encouraging. Now that the United States is back in the Paris Agreement, we intend to demonstrate our leadership in order to spur other countries to raise their own ambitions. Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad. To that end, we're launching a high-level Climate Ambition Ministerial and to align our policies and our goals and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Prime Minister Trudeau and I share an unwavering faith in the capacity of our peoples to meet the challenges of this new age if we lead with our core strengths: our democratic values, our diverse and dynamic peoples. We both recognize our responsibility, as leading democracies, to defend our shared values around the world and to strengthen our own democracies at home. That means rooting out systemic racism and unconscious bias from our institutions and our laws, as well as our hearts. Today we agreed to reestablish the Cross-Border Crime Forum and work together to modernize our approach to community safety and to do all—the most we can—do more to take on racism and discrimination in both our systems. Canada and the United States are not only vital partners, we're NATO allies, committed to shared defense. The Prime Minister and I discussed our work with our European allies to bolster transatlantic security, which includes meeting our Wales commitments. We also agreed to modernize the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, which is still the only binational military command of its kind. And we will launch an expanded U.S-Canadian Arctic dialogue to cover issues related to continental security, economic and social development, and Arctic governance. And finally, coming on the heels of the G-7 meeting last Friday, it was an opportunity for Prime Minister Trudeau and I to explore our bilateral partnership to reinforce and help drive issues of concern in our hemisphere and globally. That includes coordinating our approaches to better compete with China and to counter threats to our interest and values. Let me reiterate our support for the release of the detained Chinese—the detained in China, two Canadians: Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, excuse me. Human beings are not bartering chips. You know, we're going to work together until we get their safe return. Canada and the United States will stand together against abuse of universal rights and democratic freedoms. We're going to strengthen our shared commitment to providing safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers and so much more. The United States has no closer and no more important friend than Canada. Our nations share a close geography and history that will forever bind us together, but our values are even more consequential. It's—but it's the shared spirit of our people that's going to ensure ours is a future of hope and opportunity. Canadians and Americans are innovative, creative, entrepreneurial, competitive, open hearted, and rights respecting. There's nothing we cannot achieve when we commit ourselves to it. And when we work together, as the closest of friends should, we only make each other stronger. So thank you again, Mr. Prime Minister, for your friendship and for your leadership. And I look forward to when we're able to meet in person and all that Canada and the United States are going to accomplish together. So God bless you, and thanks for today. [At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke virtually from Ottawa, Canada.] Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you so much, Joe. Thank you, tout le monde. Merci tout le monde. Thank you. Let me begin by saying that all of us are thinking of our friends in Texas right now. I know SaskPower has been sending electricity down. And as I told the President, Canada is here to help however we can. Mr. President, it's been great to sit down with you this afternoon. This is, of course, not the first time we've worked together. Back in 2016, I had the pleasure of hosting you here in Ottawa as Vice President. Over dinner, I remember talking about how the extraordinary friendship between Canada and the United States has not just weathered changing seasons, it has grown ever deeper and stronger. Well, today we're taking our next step forward. The President and I discussed the ambitious new partnership roadmap, based on shared values and priorities, that will guide our countries work together over the coming years. In the face of COVID-19, of climate change, of rising inequality, this is our moment to act. So we're not wasting any time in getting down to work. Job one remains keeping people safe and ending this pandemic. This afternoon the President and I discussed collaboration to beat COVID-19, from keeping key supplies moving and supporting science and research, to joint efforts through international institutions. We're standing united in this fight. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no transcript was provided. He then continued in English as follows.] I know the President and I are on the same page when it comes to standing up for the middle class and people working hard to join it. And with millions of families relying on the Canada-U.S partnership, this is work we must do together. Just take the energy industry. Canadian energy workers power homes on both sides of the border. It goes to show that we're all better off for this partnership. Today the President and I discussed leveraging supply chains and support for businesses to create good well-paying jobs and help people who've been hardest hit get back on their feet. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no transcript was provided. He then continued in English as follows.] We're facing tough times, there's no doubt, but we're not facing them alone. Canada and the United States are each other's closest allies, most important trading partners, and oldest friends. And we stand united to beat this pandemic and build a better tomorrow. And I know our bond will grow even stronger. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Joe, for your leadership, for your engagement. And thank you in advance for all the great work we're going to be doing together. Merci beaucoup. President Biden. Thank you, Justin. Au revoir.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Bonsoir."
"Feb 24, 2021",Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on United States Supply Chains and an Exchange With Reporters,"Folks, we're going to have a meeting today to talk about the critical supply chain issues that we—that affect us all, affect this country. The last year has shown the vulnerability we have with some of the supply chains, including the PPE that we needed badly, but had to go abroad to get. And there are current strategies—and these little chips here for automobiles that I didn't realize how many billions of chips are in here—but causing some lines to slow down and people not being laid off, but at least to shorten the shifts. And so we're going to talk about that. John Cornyn and this—again, this is a bipartisan group here—put together an effort last year that I think was a pretty good effort, dealing with how to deal with these chips, but there's other aspects of shortages as well. That's what we're going to talk about. And it's nice to have everybody down here, and—on a subject matter we all agree on, and figure out how we get it all done. So thank you all for coming on in, and I appreciate it."
"Feb 25, 2021",Remarks on Commemorating the 50 Millionth COVID-19 Vaccine Shot,"The President. Good afternoon. The Vice President and I had a very productive meeting with a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members to address an issue of both concern for our economic security, as well as our national security: the resilience and reliability of our critical supply chains. This is a critical area where Republicans and Democrats agreed it was one of the best meetings—it's the best meeting I think we've had so far, although we've only been here about 5 weeks. But it was like the old days—people actually are on the same page. We were—there were—good, bipartisan work has already been done. The leaders of this operation in the House and Senate already did—have done great work, and I want to thank them for their leadership. We're here to build on that. And the bottom line is simple: The American people should never face shortages in the goods and services they rely on, whether that's their car or their prescription medicines or the food at the local grocery store. And remember, the shortages in PPE during the pandemic—that meant we didn't have the masks; we didn't have gowns or gloves to protect our frontline health workers. We heard horror stories of doctors and nurses wearing trash bags over their gown—over their dress in order to—so they wouldn't be in trouble—they—because they had no gowns. And they were rewashing and reusing their masks over and over again in the OR. That should never have never happened. And this will never happen again in the United States, period. We shouldn't have to rely on a foreign country—especially one that doesn't share our interests or our values—in order to protect and provide our people during a national emergency. That's why one of the first Executive orders I signed, as some may remember, was to ensure that we're manufacturing more protective equipment for health care workers here at home. And today I'm shortly going to be signing another Executive order that will help address the vulnerabilities in our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy so that the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves. This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era—pandemics, but also in defense, cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more. And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America's competitive edge by investing here at home. As I've said from the beginning, while I was running: We're going to invest in America. We're going to invest in American workers. And then, we can be in a much better position to even compete beyond what we're doing now. Resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains are going to help revitalize our domestic manufacturing capacity and create good-paying jobs, not $15 an hour—which is what we need to do someday, and sooner is better, in my view—but jobs that are at the prevailing wage. We're going to spare new—spur new opportunities for small businesses, communities of color, and economically distressed areas. And I will drive new investment in research and innovation and our workforce, investing in training and university partnerships that are going to lead to new technologies and new solutions. And all this won't just strengthen our domestic capacity, it will help unleash new markets around the world and grow opportunities for American businesses to export their goods that we're going to be making. These are the kinds of commonsense solutions that all Americans can get behind: workers and corporate leaders, Republicans and Democrats. It's about resilience, identifying possible points of vulnerabilities in our supply chains, and making sure we have the backup alternatives or workarounds in place. Remember that old proverb: ""For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse was lost."" And it goes on and on until the kingdom was lost, all for the want of a horseshoe nail. Even small failures at one point in the supply chain can cause outside impacts further up the chain. Recently, we've seen how a shortage of computer chips—computer chips like the one I have here; you can hardly see it I imagine; it's called a ""semiconductor""—has caused delays in production of automobiles that has resulted in reduced hours for American workers. A 21st-century horseshoe nail. This semiconductor is smaller than a postage stamp, but it has more than 8 billion transistors—8 billion transistors—10,000 times thinner than a single human hair in this one chip. These chips are a wonder of innovation and design that powers so much of our country, enables so much of our modern lives to go on: not just our cars, but our smartphones, televisions, radios, medical diagnostic equipment, and so much more. We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable. I'm directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate. They've authorized the bill, but they need nearly $37 billion, short term, to make sure we have this capacity. And we'll push for that as well. But we all recognize that the particular problem won't be solved immediately. In the meantime, we're reaching out to our allies, semiconductor companies, and others in the supply chain to ramp up production to help us resolve the bottlenecks we face now. We need help to stop—we need to stop playing catchup after the supply chain crisis hit. We need to prevent the supply chain crisis from hitting in the first place. And in some cases, building resilience will mean increasing our production of certain types of elements here at home. In others, it'll mean working more closely with our trusted friends and partners, nations that share our values, so that our supply chains can't be used against us as leverage. It will mean identifying and building surge capacity that can quickly be turned into and ramped up production in times of emergency. And it will mean investing in research and development, like we did in the sixties, to ensure long-term competitiveness in our manufacturing base in the decades ahead. The order I'm about to sign does two things. First, it orders a 100-day review of four vital products: semiconductors—one; key minerals and materials, like rare earths, that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes; three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients; four, advanced batteries, like the ones used in electric vehicles. There's strong bipartisan support for fast reviews of these four areas because they're essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness. Second, this order initiates a long-term review of the industry basis of six sectors of our overall economy over the next year. These reviews will identify policy recommendations to 40 of our supply chains, to—excuse me, to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically, to start implementing those recommendations right away. We're not going to wait for a review to be completed before we start closing the existing gaps. And as we implement this work, my administration will draw on a full range of American talent—including labor and industry leaders, policy experts, scientists, farmers, engineers—to get their input. I'm grateful for the Members of Congress who came to see me, Republican leaders, as well as Democrats. They're leading the way. We're going to stay in close contact with Members of both sides of the aisle and keep advancing our shared goals. Everyone has a role to play to strengthen our supply chains in our country. This is the United States of America. We are better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century than any country in the world. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—we've ever failed to achieve if we work together. And that's what we decided to do today, and that's what we're going to do: work together. So I thank you all. I'm very optimistic about the meeting we had today with our congressional colleagues. And now I'm going to walk over and sign that Executive order. [At this point, the President signed the Executive order.] Thank you all very much. Senate Confirmation Status of the President's Cabinet Nominees  Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed that more of your Cabinet nominees have not yet been confirmed by the Senate? The President. I am, but I don't so much blame it on the Senate; I blame it on the failure to have a transition that was rational. As you know, previous administrations had a significant number of their Cabinet confirmed before they even were sworn in. That's the tradition. But we're doing fine. I think we're going to be in good shape. Q. What about Neera Tanden? The President. Thank you. Q. Neera Tanden? King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia  Q. Are you going to talk to the King of Saudi Arabia? Q. Are you going to say anything to him—— The President. I'm going to be talking to him. I have not spoken to him yet. Q. Are you going to speak to him today? Q. Are you—— U.S. Intelligence Report on the 2018 Death of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Turkey  Q. Sir, sorry, are you willing to say if you've read the Khashoggi report yet? The President. Am I going to take what? I'm sorry. Q. Have you read the Jamal Khashoggi report yet from the ODNI? The President. Yes. Yes, I have. Q. Thank you. The President. Thank you."
"Feb 25, 2021",Remarks at the National Governors Association Virtual Winter Meeting,"Well, thank you all. Dr. Fauci, thanks for your leadership, thanks for being here. Two weeks ago, I spent some time with you and Dr. Francis Collins—excuse me—the Director of the National Institute of Health, at NIH, and gave me a tour of the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland. And it's the place where our top scientists spend years researching and developing vaccines and treatments of all kinds of—for all kinds of viruses. The brilliant team there made possible the rapid deployment and development of COVID-19 vaccines, and they're truly remarkable. And this administration will follow the science to deliver more breakthroughs. You now, we are doing that to beat COVID-19 and other diseases, like cancer—which is something that's so personal to so many families, including me and Kamala's and many of yours. We've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard-MIT scientist, to serve as my Science Adviser and head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and co-lead the President's Council—the Presidential Council on Advisory Science and Technology. These are the White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists to address our most pressing needs, and they'll be part of the work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like we do DARPA in the Defense Department, which develops breakthrough projects to secure our national security. And relatedly, I'm delighted to see five of the Nation's leading cancer centers are joining forces today to build on the work of the Cancer Moonshot I was able to do during the Obama-Biden administration to help break through silos and barriers in cancer research. We're making progress. There is so much we can do, so much progress within our reach. And that's why I'm thankful to the folks here today for getting their vaccine shots: Gerald Bunn, who—and Corey Hamilton, both DC firefighters. I said to Corey, you know, that old expression, ""God made man, and then he made a few firefighters."" Thank God we have them. And Linda Bussey is a manager at a Safeway grocery store in Bethesda. Victoria Legerwood Rivera, who is a local school counselor. And Elizabeth Galloway, who is a registered nurse who administered these shots. And the more people get vaccinated, the faster we're going to beat this pandemic. That's why one of my first goals in office when I—just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get a hundred million COVID-19 vaccine shots in people's arms in my first hundred days as President. At first, critics said that goal was too ambitious; no one could do that. And then, they said it was too small. But the bottom line, though, is that America will be the first country—perhaps the only one—to get that done. And today I'm here to report we're halfway there: 50 million shots in just 37 days since I've become President. That's weeks ahead of schedule, even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms, which devastated millions of Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South. We're moving in the right direction, though, despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration, which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans. And every time we administer another 50 million shots, I'm going to use that milestone to report to the American people on our vaccination program and on our overall fight against this pandemic. The good and the bad, I'll tell you; the success and the failures. And here's the deal—here's the deal—the story of this vaccination campaign is like the story of everything hard and new America does: some confusion and setbacks at the start, and then if we do the right things, we have the right plan to get things moving. That's what we're seeing right now. Weeks before I became President, the previous administration saw 6 million shots administered in the last week. This coming week, we will administer over 12 million shots, double the pace, in just 6 weeks that we've been in office. Other milestones: We've increased vaccination distribution to States by 70 percent. Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot. It was 14 percent 6 weeks ago. And close to 50 percent of people over the age of 65 have at least one shot now. It was 8 percent 6 weeks ago. It's important because people over 65 account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths. Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term facilities have gotten their first shot. And those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May. Here's how we've been doing it: It starts with increasing the supply. My team has worked very hard with vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, to ensure we have enough supply for all adult Americans by the end of July. When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers weren't being prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to make the vaccine, we fixed the problem. I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, which has already helped increase vaccine production. Last week, I toured the Pfizer facility—manufacturing facility in a plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It's an incredible—it's incredible the precision, the safety, the pride, and the sense of purpose everyone involved in that process and project has. We've all seen the news about Johnson and Johnson's vaccine. The idea of a third safe and effective vaccine is very promising. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is viewing the data and review recommendations from an outside committee of experts that will be meeting tomorrow. Now, let me be clear: We are going to do this the right way. The FDA will decide on an emergency use authorization of a vaccine based on science, not due to any political pressure from me or anyone else. No outside factors. What I will say to the American people is this: If—if—the FDA approves the use of this new vaccine, we have a plan to roll it out as quickly as Johnson and Johnson can make it. We'll use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine, and we'll make even more rapid progress on overall vaccines in March. I'll have more to say about this in the days after the FDA review. Look, we've been laser-focused on the greatest operational challenge this country has ever undertaken: administering shots in the arms of hundreds of millions of Americans. We're increasing the number of vaccinators. What we found was, you may have the vaccine but not enough people put the vaccinate—vaccine in someone's arm, like you just saw. We brought back retired doctors and nurses. We've already deployed more than 1,500 medical personnel you see during national disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA; and we commissioned—our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Defense Department, including the National Guard—supplying vaccinators. We're lining up thousands more to do the vaccinations. We're also setting up more places for people to get vaccinated. As of today, we've provided $3.8 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up the existing ones that are there already; working with Governors across the country, in red and blue States, to bolster their efforts to stand up hundreds of vaccination centers: from stadiums, to community centers, houses of worship, large parking lots. We're providing personnel and equipment and covering the costs for the States, including for the use of their National Guard, which have been—they're incredible. Today Jill and I—or I should say, tomorrow Jill and I will travel to Houston, Texas, to tour one of the first Federal mass vaccination centers and to thank everyone involved. This is an example of the kind of partnership between Federal, State, and local governments and public and private partners that's going to get this job done. We also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies all across America to make it easier for folks to get the vaccine shot like they would their flu shot, going to a familiar place, familiar folks that they can trust and know to get the shot. And for folks who didn't live near—don't live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile units. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don't have transportation to get the shots—to get to the places to get the shots. We've also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard—the hard-to-reach folks in cities and small towns, in rural communities; in Black, Latino, Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other groups. As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in 5 weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world—any country in the world—with among the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated. That's progress we promised. And it's also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID cases and hospitalizations are coming down. But I need to be honest with you: Cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new variants as they emerge. So I want to make something really very clear: This is not a time to relax. We must keep washing our hands, stay socially distanced, and for God's sake—for God's sake—wear a mask. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things. And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down. Of course, it's my hope to come back in the next—to report that we've—after we've done another 50 million shots before the end of my first 100 days. But here's the critical point. As hard as it is now to believe, we're going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe as late as April or May, where many predict that instead of long lines of people waiting to get a shot, we'll face a very different scenario: We'll have the vaccine waiting. We'll have ramped up vaccine supplies. We'll have administrative—folks to administer the shots to the most of the people who aren't eager to get the shots. At least, that's been the prediction. I don't think—I think—I don't think it's going happen; I think the more people see other people getting the shots, it's going to build confidence. But you know, at the same time, there are people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can't get them. And there are folks who are hesitant to take the shot in the first place. And we all know there's a history in this country of subjecting certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse. But if there is one message that needs to cut through, it's this: The vaccines are safe and effective. And I believe as you see your neighbor, your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter getting it, that you will be much more inclined to get it. Listen to Dr. Fauci. Listen to the scientists who developed these vaccines, and the extensive and rigorous review that it went through. I did. I took my shots publicly to demonstrate to the American people that it's safe and effective. But the time is coming, maybe 60 to 90 days, when the supply is adequate, but not enough people can access the shots or don't want them. To address that challenge, we're going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about vaccines, that they are safe and effective, and where to go to get those shots in the first place. And we're going to bring together leaders of all segments of our society to educate and encourage all Americans to get vaccinated. So I hope the Senate will soon confirm a key leader to that effort, my nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, who did so well in his hearing this week. And I hope Congress passes the American Rescue Plan, which I've been pushing, which provides funds for everything we need to do to beat this pandemic and to get the economy going again. Now, critics say the plan is too big, that it costs too much. But let me ask a rhetorical question: What would you have me cut? What would you have me cut out? On vaccines alone, if we don't invest 20 million—billion dollars to vaccinate the Nation—doesn't that make sense? Or $160 billion in total towards the pandemic for testing, to protective gear, to vaccine production and distribution? I'm ready to hear any ideas on what will make the American Rescue Plan better, stronger, and effective. But we'll have to answer who will get helped and who will get hurt. I want to close with this: The question I ask—I'm asked most often is, ""When will things get back to normal?"" My answer is always honest and straightforward. I can't give you a date. I can only promise that we'll work as hard as we can to make that day come as soon as possible. While things are improving, and we're going from a mess we inherited to moving in the right direction, at significant speed, this is not a victory lap. This—everything is not fixed. We have a long way to go. And the—that day, when everything gets back to normal, depends on all of us. It depends on Congress passing the American recovery act—research plan—Recovery Plan. And also for us to remain vigilant, to look out for one another. I've said it before: Wash your hands. Stay socially distanced. Wear a mask. Get the vaccine when it's your turn. When your friend or neighbor or loved one is eligible, encourage them to get vaccinated. And when all—above all, remember: We can do this. This is the United States of America. There is nothing we can't do when we do it together. So it's not over yet, but we're getting close. And, God willing, if we do all we know we have to do, we're going to beat this; beat it sooner than later. And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your time. Q. Mr. President, whatever happened to your promise from 7 weeks ago that if Democrats flipped the Senate that checks were going out the door? Q. Have you spoken with the King of Saudi Arabia?"
"Feb 26, 2021","Remarks at the Federal Emergency Management Agency COVID-19 Mass Vaccination Site in Houston, Texas","The President. Thank you very much. Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate it a lot. I appreciate your friendship. Let me start by saying: Guaranteed, if we're able to, we'll not only have you next year, at this time, for the Governors' conference, but we'll have whatever food you want. We can go around to each one of you. We just order individually. But all kidding aside, I'm anxious to see—I wish you could all be here because it's much better if we're all—we all do better when we're able to look at each other in the eye and know what we're talking about. But thank you. Some of you have been here in the meantime, but I hope to have the Governors' conference here next year, God willing. You know, I've been talking to several of you quite a lot—a bit lately. And as you know, we have approved disaster declarations in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. In Texas, FEMA was already on the ground providing support for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. So they were able to move quickly to supply generators, food, blankets, and, most importantly, water. And, Governor Abbott, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to coming down tomorrow, to Houston, to be with you. And I want you and the residents to know that we're here to provide the Federal assistance you need to support your State, your local, and Tribal response efforts. And it's clear that even when the immediate crisis passes, there's going to be more work to be done to help constituents recover. And my administration will be there every step of the way with you because when people in this country need help, they're not Democrats or Republicans, they're all Americans. And people who need work, they're the people getting sick from COVID, and people facing eviction, people going hungry, people struggling with the opioid crisis, and people who need broadband—they're not Democrats or Republicans, they're our fellow Americans. And I think the whole spirit of this Governors' conference and our administration is changing the attitude a little bit about how we deal with one another, at least I hope so. As Governors, you know this: You know that you have one job, and that's to deliver. You're in the frontlines—to overuse that phrase, but it's hard to overuse it. And as the saying goes, ""You're the laboratories of democracy."" Your challenges can provide—prove to be lessons for everybody. Your successes can prove to be a model for everybody. The storms that hit the south were a painful reminder that so many of our challenges don't stop at our border of our States. They don't make distinctions based on how the State is made up. Today I want to focus on two of those challenges that cross borders: COVID and the economy. You know better than I do: As you know, the ability to deal with one will determine our ability to address the other. On Monday, our Nation passed a grim, grim milestone: COVID-19 has now taken over 500,000 of our fellow Americans. That's more than died in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war combined. And most Governors, that's more than the population of your largest cities in your State or your Territories—gone. Gone. And as a country, we have to remember those we lost, but particularly those we left behind. But as we remember, we also have to act to end the politics of misinformation that has divided families, communities, and the country and that has cost too many lives already. We have to fight this together, as one, to state the obvious. I know you all know this. As a friend of mine, you say you not only understand me, you ""overstand"" me. We're the United States of America, and this cruel winter is not over. And if we come together, we can usher a more hopeful spring. We can usher it in. And that's what we're working to do together. As you know, I came into office, and I set a goal which was mocked for—by some; none of you, but by some. I set a goal of saying we're going to do hundred million shots—get hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days as President. I directed Jeff Zients, my COVID Response Coordinator, to lead my administration and work with vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and speed up delivery. We used, as some of you have suggested, the Defense Production Act to speed up supply chains for key equipment like fill pumps and filters, which have helped increase vaccine production. We've increased vaccine allocations as Andrew said—as the Governor said—to your States by almost 70 percent since coming into office, whatever number days ago it's been, 37 or something like that. We secured enough vaccine to supply 300 million Americans—300 million—to take care of all their needs, in terms of vaccination, by the end of July. And we're all—and we've all seen in the news that Johnson and Johnson vaccine is—if the FDA approved the use of this new vaccine, we would plan to roll out as quickly as Johnson and Johnson can make the vaccine. Of course, it's not just getting the vaccines, it's getting the vaccines into arms. And this is another place where your work and our partnership is making a big difference. I've signed an order to allow retired doctors and nurses to give shots. We've deployed—as you referenced indirectly, at least, Andrew—we've deployed over 1,500 Federal personnel as vaccinators, and we're funding 1,200 of your guards men and women to serve as vaccinators as well. And we're paying for your Guard for that purpose. We'll work with you to create more places where Americans can get vaccinated, supporting communities in high-volume vaccine centers and across your States. The result is that we have doubled the daily vaccination rate from where it was when we took office, and we've completed 50 million shots in 37 days. And we're now—we've now given more shots than any nation in the entire world. Nearly 60 percent of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot. It was 14 percent 6 weeks ago. Close to 50 percent—because of your help—of the people over 65 have received one shot. It was 8 percent 6 weeks ago. And this is so important because people over 65, as you know better than anyone, account for 80 percent—80 percent—of all the COVID deaths. Additionally, about 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities have gotten their first dose. And those cases are at their lowest level since reporting began in May. At the same time, we're also delivering more than 25 million masks—ordered this last week—25 million masks to over 60,000 food pantries, soup kitchens, community health centers all across America, helping protect some of our Nation's most vulnerable people. And all—and these are all necessary steps to helping the economy rebuild. Necessary steps, not only—but not only steps; it's enough to build back to where we were before. We need to build back better. And we—I think we—all of us know how to do that. We remember what happened in the States back in 2008: Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappeared every month in that Great Recession. And we passed the Recovery Act. We provided State and local fiscal aid. We sent funding to your school districts to help save over 300,000 education jobs. We provided middle class tax relief. We invested in the future, rebuilding roads and bridges; making the biggest clean energy investment in history and the single biggest investment in infrastructure since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway program. And we created, in the process—you all created in the process over thousands—hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. Now, economists tell us that saved us from a depression. Well, that's the approach I think we need to take today. But there's one big difference: We need to be more ambitious right now. The greatest risk from all the major economists, from Wall Street to overseas to the major think tanks, is that we don't do enough of what is needed; it's when we do too little. You know, in every one of your States and Territories, red and blue, millions of Americans are hurting badly. We see it in ways that we've never expected in America. Four hundred thousand small businesses gone in an instant. Gone. People who thought they had secure jobs out of work, due to no fault of their own. The difference here is, people are hurting through no fault of their own. Lines miles long in your States. People who never ever, ever, ever thought they'd ever have to worry about going hungry, waiting for someone to put a box of groceries in their trunk. Women's participation in the workforce—you all know this—is driven to its lowest level in more than three decades. So many women are facing the devastating choice between a paycheck, and care and education of their child. Our cities and towns have shed 1.3 million jobs since just last March: educators, nurses, cops, firefighters, other essential workers. The economic toll of this pandemic continues to tear through our country as brutally as the virus itself. And so we need to comfort [confront]* the economic—you know, we just have to step up. The economic toll we have to address with the same aggressiveness and seriousness of purpose as we do the virus. And that's what the American Rescue Plan does. Instead of chasing COVID-19, it allows us to get ahead of it with more testing, supplies, vaccinations. It gets our kids back to school safely—many of you are already doing that—so students can catch up on learning they've lost and parents can finally catch a break. The American Rescue Plan finishes the job of getting a total of 200,000—or $20,000 in direct payments to people. Getting direct relief to people is a lifeline for them and bumps our economy into higher gear. And there's more to the American Rescue Plan, and much more it will do: provide flexible aid to your cities and States to help essential workers stay in the job and essential services keep going. It provides rent relief, food, and nutrition and assistance to millions of children and families facing hunger. And the American Rescue Plan also expands access to affordable childcare that's going to enable parents, particularly mothers, to get back to work. It provides assistance to mom-and-pop small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth and the glue of our communities. And it covers the cost of paid leave for businesses whose workers are sickened by COVID-19. And it fills an important gap in our Nation's safety net that helps reduce the spread of the virus. I could go on. I'm probably already going on too long. But you know a lot of it already because the plan was created to include many of the things you have individually and collectively asked me for in recent conversations. The bottom line is: The American Rescue Plan meets the moment. An analysis by Moody's estimates that it will help the economy create 7 million more jobs this year alone. And it would be on the way to another 18 million jobs, Moody's estimates, would be created over the next 4 years with our Build Back Better recovery plan. Look, what we do now will determine whether we build from a position of strength or whether we lose years to sluggish and unequal recovery. And the only way to contain this pandemic and help the American people as quickly as possible is passing the plan as quickly as possible. The vast majority the American people from both parties support it, according to the data. I'm grateful to many of you, Democrats and Republicans, who have expressed support as well. We are not the type of nation that can or will stand by and watch our people suffer needlessly through no fault of their own. It goes against our conscience. It goes against sound economics. It's not who we are. We're a people who know that there's nothing we've ever failed to do when we've set our mind to doing it. So let's get this done. I've gotten over 400 mayors contacted me to get this plan passed. I—a lot of you have moved to do that. Send millions of Americans—wherever they live, whoever they voted for—a strong message that help and hope are on the way. We can do this. And I hope that Jill and I, as I said, can welcome you all to the White House next year's—for next year's meeting. And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We've got a lot to do, guys, but we can do it."
"Feb 27, 2021",Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"You're all being very polite. You've been with me all day, and it's dinner time. [Laughter] Good afternoon—or almost. Actually, it's evening. And I want to thank you, Governor and Mrs. Abbott, for your hospitality and your friendship. And Representative—Senator Cornyn, I think he had to go back; I think he's getting on a plane. He told me last—he came in to see me last event. And Representatives Shirley [Sheila]* Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pannilli—excuse me, Pannill [Elizabeth Pannill Fletcher]*—and—what am I doing here? I'm going to lose track here. And Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo. Thank you all for welcoming us. Severe Winter Storms  And Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple of reasons: First and foremost, to let the people of Texas know our prayers are with you in the aftermath of this winter storm. And secondly, to let you know what I told Governor Abbott and Mayor Turner and Judge Hidalgo and the congressional delegation: that we will be true partners to help you recover and rebuild from the storms and this pandemic and the economic crisis. We're in for the long haul. Earlier today we received an update on the storm relief efforts from—from Harris County, at the Harris County Emergency Operations Center. The folks there are doing God's work, as my mother would say. It was an important update on how the Federal Government and the States are working together through the major disaster declaration and the emergency declarations that I made after the storm hit when the Governor contacted me. The Federal Emergency Management, FEMA, is providing millions of gallons of water and millions of meals, direct assistance, to uninsured homeowners to repair the damage burst pipes caused to millions of homes across this State. And the public assistance that comes with a disaster declaration ensures that mayors and county officials can find shelter for folks in need and keep them safe and warm. This in addition to the more than 125,000 blankets FEMA has also made available to storm victims so children and families don't go to sleep cold. FEMA, working with the Defense Logistics Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from the Defense Department, has made generators and diesel fuel available to hospitals and nursing homes and other critical facilities to keep the lights on and speed power restoration along the way. Many local military bases are helping efforts to distribute water and food, fuel, and blankets all across this State. And I especially want to thank the servicemembers for helping your fellow Americans in time of need. When we have a problem, we always call on the military—domestic or foreign—no matter what. You're the best in the world. And I know millions of Texans have been impacted by the disruption of community water systems as a result of the power outages. The Environmental Protection Agency has deployed mobile drinking water labs in Houston, San Antonio, and Fort Worth to test water so we can get the—so you can get boil water advisories lifted and get safe drinking water flowing through those faucets again. There's more, but let me say this: We're not here today as Democrats or Republicans. We're here today as Americans. The American leaders, with responsibility—all of us here in this parking lot—responsibility to all the people we serve. When a crisis hits our States, like the one that hit Texas, it's not a Republican or Democrat who's hurting, it's our fellow Americans who are hurting. And it's our job to help everyone in need. Look out for one another. Leave nobody behind. COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts  That's what we've seen today in our visit. After our briefing on the storm relief, we stopped by the Houston Food Bank that's also doing God's work—incredible operation—just like everyone else here in this—in the vaccination center. They've done thousands of people. Thousands of people. It's making a fundamental difference in the safety and security of people. The more people get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic. That's why one of my first steps and my first goals as President was to announce that I was going to get 100 million COVID vaccine shots administered in my first 100 days. And because of the people behind me and others, America would be the—is going to be the first in the country—perhaps the first in the world—to get that done. And I'm proud to say we're halfway there: 50 million shots. Actually, I was telling the Congressman earlier, I carry a little card with me. And it lists, every day, the number of—the actual number of vaccines that have been administered. As of today, five—as of last night, 503,587—every single one matters—in just 37 days. Weeks ahead of schedule. We're weeks ahead of schedule. Even with setbacks from the winter storm, we're moving in the right direction. Look, in the last 6 weeks, we've gone from 6 million shots right before we took office, in total, to 12 million shots per week now. We've increased vaccine distribution by 70 percent. Sixty percent of the people over the age of six—60 percent of the people over the age of 75 have received at least one shot. Close to 50 percent of the people over the age of 65 got at least one shot. And you say, why am I focused on that? Well, it's especially important because people over the age of 65 account for 80 percent of all the COVID deaths. Eighty percent. Roughly 75 percent of the people who live in long-term care facilities now have gotten their first dose, and those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May. We're making this progress because of all of you. The Federal Government and the States are working together along with public and private partners. It starts with supply. We worked with vaccine manufacturers—Pfizer and Moderna—to ensure we have enough supply to supply all adults in America by the end of July. And we discovered that vaccine manufacturers, though, weren't getting prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to fix their problem of not being able to go more rapidly. So I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment that's already helped increase vaccine production. Last week, I toured the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It's incredible: the precision, the safety, the pride, the sense of purpose, everyone involved at that facility. And we've all seen the news about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today. It's just the third safe, effective vaccine. And it's out. They've approved it today. We're going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine—the third vaccine—to make even more rapid progress at getting shots in people's arms. Here's what else we're doing: We're increasing the number of vaccinators. The people putting the—it's one thing to have the vaccine; it's another thing to get it in people's arms. We've brought back retired doctors and nurses by Executive order, allowing that to happen. We've already deployed more than 1,500 professionals—medical professionals—you see during natural disasters from FEMA, our Commissioned Corps from the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard. And we're lining up thousands more. We're also setting up more places to get vaccinated. And today—as of today, we provided $3.8 billion to States, Territories, and Tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up existing ones. We're providing personnel and equipment, and we're covering the costs for States, including the use of their National Guards. Here in Texas, it's meant millions of dollars and hundreds of vaccinators working at community vaccination centers and three mass vaccination centers in Arlington, Dallas, and right here in Houston, on the other side here, that vaccinate thousands of Texans a day. Tens of thousands overall. I want to show the American people the extraordinary effort being made and undertaken in the most difficult operational challenge this Nation has ever faced logistically. It's remarkable. About 6,000 doses a day here. Folks who are eligible can call by phone, sign up online for an appointment, drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, in and out in a very short amount of time. It requires massive logistical coordination and critical Federal support from FEMA and the National Guard to work with cities and States, and the Houston Texans, to stand up this kind of site. Vice President Harris and I did a virtual tour of a similar vaccination center in Arizona. One nurse—one nurse there said—she talked about the shots, talking how many they were getting in people's arms, and she said she felt like she was administering—and get this—a ""dose of hope."" A dose of hope. We're working with Governors across the country to stand up and lend Federal support to hundreds of vaccination centers: from stadiums, like here, to community centers, to houses of worship, large parking lots, delivery places. Doses of hope we can get in people's arms as quickly as possible. I've also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies—over 7,000—to make it easier for folks to get the COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would a flu shot, because people are comfortable going to their local pharmacy. They go there for their flu shot and everything else. They trust the pharmacist, and they're likely to go. Here in Texas, that includes 500 pharmacies across this State, like Walmart and CVS, including 50 pharmacies here in Houston. And for the folks who didn't live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we're deploying mobile clinics to go out to those neighborhoods in rural areas where people are unable to get to the centers. These are special vehicles with pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don't have the transportation to get the shots, which they'll be launching very soon here in Houston—that mobile—those mobile units—as well as Dallas, Arlington, and across the State. We've also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard-to-reach folks in cities, small towns, and rural communities; in Black, Latino, and Native American communities that have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other group. Here in Texas, we're already partnering with 12 community health centers in 10 cities, which have combined sites at over 100 locations across the entire State. We're going to save people's lives. As a result of these round-the-clock efforts, in 5 weeks, America has administered the most shots of any country in the world. That's great progress. And it's also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are down. But I need to be honest with you. I said from the beginning—like Roosevelt who said, I'll shoot you ""straight from the shoulder""—you can handle anything as long as you're told the truth. Cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new—as new variants emerge. And it's not the time to relax. We have to keep washing our hands, staying socially distanced. And for God's sake, wear your mask. Wear your mask. It's not a political statement, it's a patriotic thing to do. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing these things. And the worst thing we could do now would be let our guard down. And here's another critical point: We're going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe late April or early May, when many predict there will be ramped-up vaccine supply and we'll have administered shots to most of the people who really are eager to get them and those who have been able to get there. But at the same time, the warning is: There'll be people who live in hard-to-reach areas who can't get the shots, and there are folks who are hesitant to take the shots. We all know there's a history in this country of subjugating certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse. But if there's one message that needs to cut through all of this: The vaccines are safe. I promise you. They are safe and effective. Listen to Dr. Fauci. Listen to the scientists who developed them through extensive and rigorous review. I did. And I took my shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people it's safe and effective. To address this challenge, we're going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about the vaccines: that they are safe and effective, and that they can go and get those shots and be good. I'm going to close with this: This past year has been one of the most painful years in American history. As I said, we've lost over 500,000 lives to the virus. Five hundred thousand moms and dads, husbands and wives, sons and daughters staring at an empty chair at that dining room table or the kitchen table; friends, neighbors, coworkers, and over the country—all over the country where the loved ones who are gone—they're gone. Empty. Empty feeling in your chest, like you're being sucked into a black hole in your chest. But all over the country, where loved ones once sat, there's an empty chair. And, folks, look, there's so much we can do. As you see the broken hearts in the families that have been left behind, there's nothing partisan about this virus. It's too long we've allowed the virus to divide us. I met today with Governor Abbott, Senator Cornyn—conservative Republicans. I'm a Democratic President. We disagree on plenty of things, and there's nothing wrong with that. But there are plenty of things we can work on together, and one of them is represented right here today: the effort to speed up vaccinations. We're not giving shots to Democrats or Republicans. I say it again: We're giving shots to Americans. All across the country, we've got members of the Armed Forces, FEMA, volunteers, retirees, fellow Americans working around the clock to give these shots. And they're building on the work of scientists, researchers, doctors, and nurses. And my team at the White House, which is coordinating all of this, is first rate. None of this has a partisan tinge or a partisan element to it. This can be a great American achievement—being the only country in the world to reach 100 million shots in 100 days. This could unite us as a country—to vaccinate America, to protect America, to heal America. And I know we can do this. Why? Because I know America can do great things when we do it together. I know my family spent a lot of time here in Houston, by the way, at—hey, John Eddie. How are you, buddy? I didn't see you there. At Houston, at MD Anderson, when our son Beau was being treated for glioblastoma before he passed away. Just yesterday I saw MD Anderson announce its joint—he joined four—they joined four other major cancer hospitals to help break down the silos that make real progress in this effort difficult. Now they're sharing data and information. That wasn't going on 4 or 5 years ago. We're going to beat cancer. I know we will. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: If there is just one thing—one thing—I could be known for as President, it would be to end—the President who, during his era, ended cancer as we know it. But then, last week—guess what?—we also landed a rover on Mars. We—led by a NASA team in Pasadena, California. A rover carries instruments developed by a team here in Houston that will be used in the mission of our time and our dreams. Imagine. We tell—everybody has been so down the last number of years about what America—what can we do? Who are—we can do anything! America can do anything. And now we see the images that are truly stunning: battling COVID, beating cancer, going to Mars. If there's one thing I know about America, it's this: Americans never give up. They never give in. They never cry uncle. They just struggle, innovate, and they preserve—and persevere. We're going to get through all of this, I promise you. And we're going to do it together. Together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. You're the best. We can do all of this, guys. I promise you. We can do this. Nobody in the world can compete with us when we're together. Thank you all so very much."
"Mar 01, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good morning, folks. For a few weeks now, an overwhelming percentage of the American public has made it clear that they support my American Rescue Plan. And the House of Representatives took the first step toward making it a reality. And I want to thank—and I called her just a few moments ago—Nancy Pelosi for her extraordinary—Speaker Pelosi—for her extraordinary leadership and all those who supported our plan. And with their vote, we are one step closer to vaccinating the Nation. We are one step closer to putting $1,400 in the pockets of Americans. We are one step closer to extending unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who are shortly going to lose them. We're one step closer to helping millions of Americans feed their families and keep a roof over their head. We're one step closer to getting our kids safely back in school. And we're one step closer to getting State and local governments the money they need to prevent massive layoffs for essential workers. Now the bill moves to the United States Senate where I hope it will receive quick action. I have—we have no time to waste. If we act now—decisively, quickly, and boldly—we can finally get ahead of this virus. We can finally get our economy moving again. And the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long. We need to relieve that suffering. The American Rescue Plan does just that: It relieves the suffering. And it's time to act. I thank you all for being here. I appreciate it. Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed that things—[inaudible]? Q. President Biden, will you punish the Crown Prince for murdering Khashoggi? Will you punish the Crown Prince? Q. [Inaudible]—proposal? Q. [Inaudible]—Republican support?"
"Mar 02, 2021",Remarks on COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. It's great to be with you, Mr. President. You know, this is—my second call to a foreign leader in my third day as President was you. And now you're my second virtual meeting with a foreign leader, and that's not by accident. The important of our relations—the importance of our relationship with Mexico is vital to the North American partnership we have and paramount to all the elements of my administration's priorities. So I'm delighted to be with you. Of the 16 visits I made to Latin America and the Caribbean as Vice President, four of them were to Mexico, and I was honored to meet you on one of those visits, Mr. President. During my visits, I got to know Mexico a little bit and its people and paid my respects to the Virgin of Guadalupe. As a matter of fact, I still have my rosary beads that my son was wearing when he passed. And I walked the beautiful and historic cobblestones of Mexico City and spoke with Mexicans of all walks of life. And I treasure those memories, and I hope to be able to build on them in the next 4 years. Mr. President, this is what I know: The United States and Mexico are stronger when we stand together. There's a long and complicated history between our nations, and haven't always been perfect neighbors with one another, but we have seen over and over again the power and the purpose when we cooperate. And we're safer when we work together, whether it's addressing the challenges of our shared border or getting this pandemic under control. In the Obama-Biden administration, we made a commitment that we look at Mexico as an equal, not as somebody who is south of our border. You are equal. And what you do in Mexico and how you succeed impacts dramatically on what the rest of the hemisphere will look like.  And as you know, the fastest growing population in the United States is Hispanic. And 60 percent of the Hispanic population is Mexican American. They're an integral part of our history, and I keep a bust of a civil rights leader, Chávez—César Chávez—in my Oval Office as a reminder. And, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to our discussion today and to the many ways we'll have to work together as neighbors and partners in meeting our shared challenges. And thank you for doing this. [At this point, President López Obrador spoke via videoconference from Mexico City, Mexico.]  President López Obrador. President Biden, I would like to start by thanking you for your confession regarding your devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe. We, as Mexicans, respect and admire two symbols. They might be different; however, they call to the plurality of our country. One is the Virgin of Guadalupe, as you said, and the other one is Benito Juárez, a liberal President, the best one we have ever had, a Zapotec indigenous that we are very proud of. I would like to thank you also for starting the conversation this way: Mexico—for stating that Mexico is as important to you. It is a pleasure to greet you. It is important that we base our good relationships on constant dialogue, periodic dialogue. I know our relations in the future will be even better. We are united by 3,180 kilometers of border. But we are not only united by geography; we are also united by our economies, our trade, our culture, our history, and our friendship. We had a Mexican President who dominated the country for 34 years—very little time. His name was Porfirio Díaz. And he would say, ""Poor Mexico, so far from God and yet so close to the United States."" [Laughter] I can now say that it's wonderful for Mexico to be close to God and not so far from the United States. [Laughter] I believe our countries will allow us to develop jointly in these dire times. Integration will strengthen both our countries as we are faced with this inevitable expansion of other regions. Our relations are strategic. I would like to also thank you after the call that we have had for wanting to base our relations on respect and equality. It is important for Mexico, and we must keep on cooperating for further development based on independence and autonomy, potentializing what our peoples mean to us. We are very thankful that you are willing to maintain good relations for the good of our peoples in North America: the Canadian, the United States, and the Mexican peoples. President Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to ask the press whether they'd be kind enough to exit shortly here. [Laughter] I'd appreciate it. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. Mexico-U.S. Relations  Q. Mr. President, are you sending vaccines to Mexico? Sending vaccines to Mexico? Are you sending? Are you considering? President Biden. We're going to talk about that. Q. How about a program for immigration—[inaudible]? President Biden. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, a number of Republicans—[inaudible]?"
"Mar 03, 2021",Remarks During a Meeting With Members of Congress on Cancer and an Exchange With Reporters,"Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I'd like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort. As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening—open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we're going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal. But that's—one of my first goals in office was—when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We've got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we'll make it all the way. As I—and as I've said, we have a long way to go, but you know, as I said from the outset, we're going to use every resource of the Federal Government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson and Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn't coming fast enough. So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort. As I've always said, this is a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches. And today we're announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest health care and pharmaceutical companies in the world—that are usually competitors—are working together on the vaccine. Johnson and Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson and Johnson's vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II. We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson and Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson and Johnson's vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7. In addition, we'll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. I've also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson and Johnson's efforts. And I want to thank Johnson and Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis. Here's what all this means: We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May. Let me say that again: When we came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About 3 weeks ago, we were able to say that we'll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July. And I'm pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I've ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply—I'll say it again—for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That's progress, important progress. But it's not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators—people to put the shots in people's arms, millions of Americans' arms. To date, we've brought back retired doctors and nurses. We've developed—we deployed more than 1,500 Federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come. We're also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We've sent a—millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot. The Federal Government is also working with States to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It's incredible. And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely. Right now an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We're already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation. Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn't the same for every student, as you all know. Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs. Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for—and further undermining the health of our economy. This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President. To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely—reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus—all cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well. You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It's a roadmap that will enable schools—if they have the resources they deserve—to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I've asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce. Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we've heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that. So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let's treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service—educators, school staff, childcare workers—get them vaccinated immediately. They're essential workers. Over 30 States have already taken the step to prioritize educators for vaccination. And today I'm using the full authority of the Federal Government. I'm directing every State to do the same. My challenge to all States, Territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March. To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month—the month of March—we will be using our Federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them. And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get an appointment in the first week, but our goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March. I want to conclude with this: We're making progress from the mess we inherited. We're moving in the right direction. And today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I'd be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly. Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks—keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it's your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I've asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People's lives are at stake. We have already—and I carry this in my pocket—lost more—as of today, we've lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It's got to stop. We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan, and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other Federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing States for their efforts. We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now—now. There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can't assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That's how we're going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones. So thank you. And please, please, it's not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much. Q. Mr. President, why is only 1 percent going to the vaccine, sir? Why is only 1 percent going to the vaccine, sir? Federal Coronavirus Response Efforts  Q. Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal? The President. When do I think things will get back to normal? I've been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don't know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we're going to be back to normal, and before that—my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue—continue—to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There's a lot we have to do yet. So thank you. Mexico-U.S. Border Security  Q. Did you receive a briefing about the border today? Did you receive a briefing about the border today? The President. Yes, I did. Q. What did you learn? The President. A lot. Mexico-U.S. Border Security  Q. Is there a crisis at the border, sir? The President. No, we'll be able to handle it, God willing."
"Mar 03, 2021",Remarks During the House Democratic Caucus Virtual Issues Conference,"The President. Hey, everyone. Thanks. Thanks for coming in. These are Members of the House, Senate—Democrat, Republican—who all have an extremely keen interest in doing what I said once before: that I'd love to be the President to preside over the end of cancer as we know it. These are the folks in the House and Senate who would love to preside over cancer—the end of cancer as we know it. And they all were critical in the CARES Act, which put about $9 billion into NIH to deal with cancer and cancer research. And the Vice President and I are of the view that we can make significant strides in fighting cancer and Alzheimer's and other diseases, if we take a slightly different approach. And what I want to talk with them about today is how we go about taking advantage of the work they've done to get us where we are today, because I think we're on the cusp of some real breakthroughs across the board on cancer. And that's what we're going to talk about. And probably to all of you, like all of us, cancer is personal for almost everybody. It's probably the one word that is the most frightening word in the English language to people. When they hear that ""C word,"" cancer, it is just devastating. And I always ask at—when I talk about cancer, I ask the audience if they—to raise their hand, if any of them were suffering from cancer as I spoke, and/or they lost someone, and virtually 70 percent of every audience—whether or not it's 4,000 people or 400 people. And a lot of folks in this room have, like many of you I—maybe have been victims of cancer and overcome it. But there's so much hope that that's what I want to talk about with these folks—about what we do, from a legislative and a substance point of view, to make the kind of inroads I think we can make. That's what we're talking about today. Thank you for coming in. And we're—I'm optimistic we're going to get something done here. Rocket Attacks at Ayn Al Asad Air Base in Anbar Province, Iraq  Q. Mr. President, troops—U.S. troops were targeted with rocket attacks. Any response? The President. We are following that through right now. Thank God no one was killed by the rocket. One individual, a contractor, died of a heart attack. But we're identifying who is responsible, and we'll make judgments from that point. Okay? Thank you. Removal of Texas State Mask Mandate/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts  Q. Do you have a response to Texas relaxing its COVID restrictions? The President. I didn't hear the question. Q. Message to Texas and Mississippi—Texas and Mississippi? Q. [Inaudible]—COVID restrictions? The President. Texas, I think it's a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody has realized by now: These masks make a difference. We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we're able to get vaccines in people's arms. We've been able to move that all the way up to the end of May to have enough for every American to get—every adult American to get a shot. And the last thing—the last thing—we need is Neanderthal thinking that, in the meantime, everything is fine, take off your mask. Forget it. It still matters. I carry a card with me—I don't have it. I put it on my desk. As of last—as of yesterday, we had lost 511,874 Americans. We're going to lose thousands more. This will not occur—we'll not have everybody vaccinated until sometime in the summer. We have the vaccine to do it. Getting a shot in someone's arm and getting the second shot are going to take time. And it's critical—critical, critical, critical—that they follow the science: Wash your hands—hot water; do it frequently. Wear a mask. And stay socially distanced. And I know you all know that. I wish the heck some of our elected officials knew it. So thank you very much."
"Mar 04, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Members of Congress on Infrastructure and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. [Laughter] Nancy, I love you. There's no one I'd rather work with than you. We've been friends a long time—and your whole family, your daughters. And it's just been a great relationship. And I think that Angie was absolutely correct that you've been the consummate leader. I've been here a long time, and there's been no Speaker that's been your equal, although there have been some great Speakers. And you just have a special way about you, Nancy. And you're also very, very—which is important—you're kind, but you're tough. And you know what's right, and you stick by it. And I admire the devil out of you. And I want to thank somebody I campaigned for—he was leading by 30 points until I campaigned for him, but he still won anyway—Hakeem Jeffries—and Vice Chair Aguilar for putting this conference together and including me. And I want to thank the entire leadership team and all your committee chairs for taking an important step in the American Rescue Plan last week. You all showed, at a time when the American people are depending on us—and they are desperately in need of us—that a diverse caucus isn't a divided caucus. Congressman Clyburn, I also want to note that it was almost exactly a year ago today that you delivered the endorsement to me in South Carolina that meant so much to me and my campaign. And you're a great friend. And on the night of the—that primary, America had confirmed only fewer than 100 COVID cases. That's just a year ago. Breonna Taylor and George Floyd were still alive. California had yet to suffer the worst—what would become the worst fire season in recorded history. And there'd been no violent insurrection on the Capitol Hill. And I could go on. A lot's changed. My point is this: In the year that has passed, all the challenge I spoke about that night—jobs and the economy; affordable, accessible health care; climate change; and the need to root out institutional racism; the need for unity and healing—have all become urgent—urgent, urgent, urgent—especially in light of the pandemic that has taken the lives—well, as of yesterday—518,720, I believe it was, Americans—fellow Americans who have lost their lives. And more than 400,000 businesses—mostly small businesses, many minority businesses—have been shuttered; cost of millions of jobs; 1.3 million public sector—education, nurses, cops, firefighters, essential workers—have lost their jobs. So my message today is really simple: You—you, this caucus—have shown the American people the difference Democratic leadership and what we just had. Leadership makes a difference. And you're continuing to do so. For example, I know that this week you're working on the ""Protect Our Democracy"" reforms, as well as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act—both of which I strongly support. And I know that, in the past couple of days, you've had briefings and conversations on immigration, health care, foreign policy, climate crisis, and a lot more. And as you work on all of these, I urge you to continue to speak up and speak out about the American Rescue Plan. And here is why: You know, the confidence in the American—in American government has been plummeting since the late sixties to what it is now. And many of you remember that in 2009, we expended a lot of political capital—Nancy and I and others—in the Recovery Act. It was an act that had less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in it, according to the experts, and the economists told us we literally saved America from a depression. But we didn't adequately explain what we had done. Barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a ""victory lap."" I kept saying, ""Tell people what we did."" He said: ""We don't have time. I'm not going to take a victory lap."" And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility. And this is a case where every single piece of the bill you passed addresses a genuine, desperate need for the American people. Each piece isn't just defensible, it is urgent and overwhelmingly supported by the people. It's good policy, and it's good politics. And I'm not sure we've ever seen something that is needed as badly as the American Rescue Plan that was as broadly popular. Nancy and I have passed some really important things in our careers, but they haven't always been—they've been badly needed, but they haven't been overwhelmingly popular. Served—I've served in the Congress for 36 years before becoming Vice President for 8. We never had anything this urgent and this ambitious that was so widely embraced. Three-quarters of the American are together with—on this. Three quarters. Nearly unanimous support among Democrats; more than 70 percent of independents. In poll after poll, 60 percent of Republicans—I'll say that again—60 percent of Republicans support what we're doing. A bipartisan group of more than 425 mayors, Democrat and Republican. The AFL-CIO and business leaders. Look, the show of unity we're seeing is unprecedented. It isn't just about the sum of the total package; Americans are lockstep on each major element of the plan, and they know what they are. They support what we're doing on vaccines. Look at the progress we've made with your help. We've been able to move us to the point where we had very little supply, to we will have enough vaccine because of the work we've done with your help—enough vaccine by the end of May to be able to vaccinate every single adult in America. It will not be done by then, but that supply will be there. They support what we're doing on direct payments, on unemployment insurance, on food and nutrition support, on keeping people in their homes, on safely reopening our schools. Staying unified as we complete this process to pass the American Rescue Plan won't just make a difference in our fight against COVID-19 and our efforts to rebuild the economy, it will also show the American people we're capable of coming together for what matters most to them. They've lost faith in government; this is a time to reestablish that faith. And the reason why they should have faith is because we're doing the right thing. It's a show of strength and a first step forward to restoring their faith in the capacity of government to have their backs. And if we deliver on this, it also builds momentum. It builds real enthusiasm as well. And I will make everything else we want to deliver—this will make everything more possible to get it done. That's why starting off with this victory is so important, because it's so consequential to their lives. And we know how much we have to do, but all starts—it all starts here. It starts by bringing this home, bringing home what you've done all the way. And I know we're all making some small compromises, but I want to thank you. I want to thank you for the work you've done. I want to thank you for the work we're going to continue to do. I know parts of this—and everything else we seek to do—are not easy, but people are going to remember how we showed up in this moment, how we listened to them—to them, not special interests; to them—and how we took action. I believe we're going to come through this, and I think that people's memories will be long. And if we continue to stay laser focused on getting shots in people's arms, responding to the economic crisis, it's going to open up a lot of hearts and a lot of doors for us tomorrow to do the many more things we know we have to do. So I want to thank you all. I really mean it from the bottom—I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm happy to take questions if that's what—I'm supposed to do, Nance. Whatever you want me to do."
"Mar 04, 2021",Remarks to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Perseverance Rover Team,"The President. Hey, everybody. We've brought a group of bipartisan leaders on infrastructure, among other things, from the House that are here. We're going to talk about infrastructure and American competitiveness and what we're going to do to make sure we once again lead the world across the board in infrastructure. It's a—it not only creates jobs, but it makes us a hell of a lot more competitive around the world if we have the best infrastructure in the world. So we're going to be talking about that. And I welcome all my colleagues here. And thank you all for coming on in. So thank you. Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, Republicans have been trying to slow down the coronavirus bill. Republicans have been trying to slow down the coronavirus bill. Have you been reaching out to them to try to bring them along? The President. I've been talking to a lot of my Republican friends in the House and the Senate—continue to do that. And we have. We've met—had a number of meetings with Republicans on the coronavirus bill and—House, Senate, and a combination of both. So we're keeping everybody informed. Q. Do you have a reaction to the OPEC decision this morning, Mr. President? Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Q. Are you comfortable with having to limit the direct payments? The President. Am I comfort—— Q. Comfortable with having to limit the direct payments? The President. Yes. Thank you. Q. Do you have a reaction to the OPEC—OPEC? Q. Does the proposal include the Gateway Project, Mr. President? The President. I'm sorry. I can't hear. Thank you all for coming in. Thank you."
"Mar 05, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen,"Jet Propulsion Laboratory Director Michael M. Watkins. Mr. President? The President. Yes. Director Watkins. This is Mike Watkins at JPL. The President. Hey, Mike. How are you? Director Watkins. I want to thank you so much. We are very well, especially after the—after February 18. The President. I tell you what: You did an incredible job. Director Watkins. We thank you for that, and we appreciate that. And it's our honor to be given these kinds of tasks; it's what we live for. And so you may see here I'm surrounded by a few hundred of my best friends in this and a couple of other control rooms and online. You know, these are really big team efforts—— The President. I know. Director Watkins. ——and it's important to us to get as much of the team to join with us today as we could. And we really appreciate your time. The President. Appreciate it. I'm flattered you'd take the time to let me talk to you. Director Watkins. Well, we would love to have you out here someday. In fact, I've got two badges for you and the Vice President. So when COVID winds down, I hope you come out here and have a chance to meet the team directly. The President. I'll be happy to do that. I'll be happy to do that. Am I supposed to speak now or is Swati? Director Watkins. Thanks. We would love it. You know, one of the things I wanted to also note—I think—you know, you—I know you watched—I saw pictures of you watching the landing coverage. The President. Yes. Director Watkins. And you know, that was a great opportunity, you know, for us to show, I think, the country what, you know, we can do—and the world, really—but also, you know, to bring a whole new generation of STEM, you know, into the fold. The President. That's right. Director Watkins. And I think we had a lot of people watching who didn't know that they were STEM people, but now they are—— The President. Yes. Director Watkins. ——after having watched that. And it's something we—you know, it's very important to us. It's a major part of what we do here at JPL and, of course, NASA as an agency. And we're—it's just great to have that—you know, that bully pulpit to showcase that talent. The President. It's incredible talent. Now, am I supposed to speak or is Swati going to say something? I was told I was going to hear from Swati. Director Watkins. So either way—any way you'd like to do it is fine. We have Dr. Mohan here with me. She—of course, you know her from the landing coverage. But—— The President. Hey, Doc. How are you? Jet Propulsion Laboratory Engineer Swati Mohan. I'm doing very well, Mr. President. Thank you for—— The President. I just want you to know—— Engineer Mohan. ——for taking the time to speak with us. The President. Are you kidding me? What an honor this is. This is an incredible honor. And it's amazing. Indian—of descent—Americans are taking over the country: you; my Vice President; my speechwriter Vinay. I tell you what. But thank you. You guys are incredible. Did you want to say something? I'll be quiet. Director Watkins. Absolutely. You know, tell us how you felt on landing day and, actually, what path brought you to here at the lab. Engineer Mohan. Absolutely. So my path actually started way back when I was a child, watching my first episode of Star Trek. [Laughter] In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team who was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life. You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL where I've gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege. You know, those last days and weeks leading up to landing day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous—— The President. Yes. [Laughter] Engineer Mohan. ——and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final 7 minutes. To be able to call ""touchdown"" safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there—reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream. Now that that tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that's left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find and, hopefully, find those signs of past life on Mars. The President. Well, I tell you what, you said you feel like you're ""living a dream""—you've created a dream for millions and millions of young kids, young Americans. You talk about STEM. You—it was—look, the thing that I found so exhilarating about this: You all did this—the whole team—the team, in fact, I can see now and the entire team at JPL—what you did: You restored a dose of confidence in the American people. They were beginning to wonder about us. They were beginning to wonder: Are we still the country we always believed we were? You guys did it. You guys gave a sense of ""America is back."" It's astounding what you did. You should not underestimate it. You should not underestimate it. You know, you did it the most American way: You believed in science, you believed in hard work, and you believed there wasn't a darn thing you couldn't do if you put your minds together. One of the reasons why we're such an incredible country is, we're such a diverse country. We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their dreams run forward. And you just—I can't tell you how much—you know, everyone was so down the last years about: Is America still the, you know, the fount of change? And are we still the country that has hopes and develops and pursues the most unlikely things to happen? And we are. And you all demonstrated it. I'm not being—look, I'm not—I really mean this. It's so much bigger than landing Perseverance on Mars. It's about the American spirit, and you brought it back. You brought back in a moment we so desperately need it. I was reaching—I was talking to a head of state who was calling me about thanking me—or not thanking me—congratulating me on becoming President. And then, I later heard from another head of state, saying: ""America has changed so much. They used to be so competent to do great things, and here they can't even deal with the coronavirus. Look how badly organized they are."" That was said by a head of state. And America's image in the world—and it matters. It matters because democracies have to demonstrate they can run as efficiently and more efficiently than autocracies. There's a big battle going on. Your kids are going to be studying about when democracy once again reestablished it could do anything, as opposed to autocracies that can just command things. I just can't tell you how much I believe historians are going to write about what you did at the moment you all did it—at the moment you all did it. You should take such great pride—such great pride—in what you did. We can land a rover on Mars. We can beat a pandemic. And with science, hope, and vision, there's not a damn thing we can't do as a country. We have never, ever, ever failed to meet a goal. We've set our mind to it, and we've done it together. And that's what you all showed. So it goes way beyond—way beyond—the whole notion of what you just recently did. And God only knows what is going to come from this. God only knows what's going to happen. But you all are incredible. All the dreams you've created in other people's minds, other young kids. I tell you what: I just wanted to thank you and tell you, you know, you—it just seems that, you know, we're on the side of the angels. Just at the moment when things look like they're really dark in America over our history, something has come along. Something has come along. And you guys came along and you did this. And so I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and tell you how presumptuous of me to say I'm proud of you, but I am so proud of you. And, Mike, the teamwork that still exists there, the importance of it, the consequence of what you're doing—and it's only just the start. I had a group of folks in my office not too long ago—House and Senate Members—I mean, House Members—Democrats and Republicans—talking about infrastructure. And I have in the—on the shelf in my Oval Office, a Moon rock. And they walked over and said, ""This is actually a Moon rock, from the Moon?"" And I jokingly said: ""You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until see what comes home from Mars."" So, anyway, folks, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're great Americans, and you've demonstrated it again: There's not a thing we cannot do when we set our mind to it. God bless you all. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Director Watkins. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The President. And by the way, I'm like a poor relative, Mike. When I'm invited, I show up. So be careful. You know, the poor relatives, they show up even—— Director Watkins. We will—— The President. They stay longer than they're supposed to. I'm one of those kind of guys. [Laughter] Director Watkins. Well, we will be more than happy to have you, and stay as long as you want. The President. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in person. Thank you. Director Watkins. We'll get you an office here. The President. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye-bye. Godspeed. Director Watkins. Thank you, sir. The President. John Glenn. [Laughter] All right."
"Mar 05, 2021",Remarks in a Roundtable Discussion on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"The President. Welcome, folks. Can you hear me in my mask? Q. Yes, sir. The President. All right. We're about to have an economic meeting, but I want to make a few very brief comments. Today's jobs report shows that the American Rescue Plan is urgently needed, in our view. Now, our economy still has 9.5 million fewer jobs than it had this time last year. And at that rate, it would take 2 years to get us back on track. We have 1 million fewer educators—1 million fewer educators—than we did this time last year. We've lost 400,000 small businesses. All those empty storefronts aren't just shattered dreams, they're warning lights that are going off in State and local budgets that are being stretched because of the lack of tax revenue. And some of last month's job growth is a result of the December relief package. But without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow. We can't afford one step forward and two steps backwards. We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery. People need the help now. In less than 2 weeks, enhanced unemployment benefits will begin to expire for 11 million people. At least 7 million kids don't have enough food to eat on a regular basis. Thirteen million people are behind in their rent. And the rescue plan is absolutely essential for turning this around, getting kids back to school safely, getting a lifeline to small business, and getting the upper hand on COVID-19. That's what we're going to be talking about now. So I thank you all for coming on in. Thank you. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, when will you unveil your Build Back Better plan?"
"Mar 06, 2021",Remarks on Senate Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Thanks for being here, everybody. This is important, and I appreciate you being willing to come and tell your stories. I wanted this to be a conversation about what the impact of the $1,400 that our plan has for every American out there and to make sure that I understand what you think is important about it, if you think it's important. And I also want to—you know, the people you're about to meet, the millions of people who are going to help with this—I think—with this check, that's going to make a big difference in terms of their lives. And people in the country are hurting right now, with less than 2 weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut out. And 7 million kids don't have enough food; 13 million people are behind in their rent. And the American Rescue Plan, I believe—and according to the polling data, the vast majority of Americans believe—is essential to giving them some help and to turn it around. And I think it's going to provide immediate relief for millions of people that are going to be able to use it in a very constructive way and also grow the economy in the process. But it's essential getting kids back to school safely. It is also getting a lifeline to small businesses, many of whom—400,000—have gone under, affecting entire communities. And it is clearly—clearly—necessary a lifeline for getting the upper hand against COVID-19 and getting it under control. That isn't some academic discussion. It's about you; it's about people like you and the families I grew up with all over America. And you know, you've all lived lives of service. You not only have taken care of yourself and your families, but you've lived lives of service to help other people as well. And so, as—again, this isn't an academic discussion. You deserve our thanks and our support. And I'm going to hand it back to Cedric so we can hear from you all while the press is still in here. White House Director of Public Engagement Cedric L. Richmond. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Today we're joined by three outstanding Americans that exemplify what America stands for and especially your values, which is service to others. And, first, we have Ms. Alma Williams. Ms. Williams is a paratransit driver. She transports disabled Americans every day. She has four wonderful children, and her youngest is in the process of applying to college. The other two are in college, and one is on her way. So Ms. Williams is close to being a empty nester. Then, we have George Kerr, who served in the United States Navy for almost 8 years; served on two Air Force carriers. And he volunteers, but also is starting a nonprofit small business to help people with substance use issues and health and harm effects. And he has—which you mentioned earlier—the unfortunate experience of having a house that burned down. And I know that you know that experience very well. And he's just a remarkable individual. And then, we have Ms. Lyda Vanegas, who volunteers at a DC community health center and spends her time counseling and helping Americans get through this very rough time. And she has seen the effects, firsthand, of the challenges and the pain and the suffering that American citizens are going through, which is particularly important that you say ""through no fault of their own."" And with that, Mr. President, I'm going to turn it back over to—now we'll turn it over to Ms. Williams so that she can tell us about what she thinks about the American Rescue Plan. Washington Metro Access Transit Authority driver Alma Williams. Actually, it's a wonderful plan. As well as being a paratransit operator, I'm also union rep for the ATU. The President. ATU. Ms. Williams. Yes, sir. And you know, just hearing the things that, you know, my coworkers go through is devastating. You know, we're fighting to work a maximum of less than 40 hours a week, you know? And as I stated to a colleague of mine when—we had a time when we paid our bills on the first of the month, and now we're struggling to pay them on the 15th just to—— The President. And you're still employed? Ms. Williams. Yes. You know? And it's just a hard time financially, mentally, emotionally—like, across the board for children, adults. You know? And it's just—I thank you for the plan. I think it will help a wide range of people—you know, not just the working class, but our retirees; you know, our elementary school, you know—the grade schools that—I have nieces and nephews who are very young. And just the transition of going to school every day and now being home all day, stuck behind a computer, it's draining for them too, and they don't understand it. You know? Thank you. I appreciate it. The President. Okay. I have a lot of questions, but I'm going until we hear—while the press is here—to hear from all three people. Ms. Williams. Yes, sir. The President. I'd like to talk more about this, if I can. Director Richmond. Thank you, Mr. President. With that, we'll turn it over to you, Mr. Kerr. Navy veteran George Kerr. Well, once again, thank you for having me. It's really important that we're having this conversation. I'm in full support of this piece of important legislation. As you said, I lost my home in—November 30, 2019. And then, right after that, I got really sick and then COVID happened. And thankfully I did not—have not contracted COVID. But it's led to a lot of other issues. And being an—having my own LLC, it's very difficult to find contracts right there because of the environment. And people are just not—don't have the funding to get the support they need. And so I do a lot of work with different organizations. One of them is Mary's House for Older Adults, where we have a—reach out and touch someone, who talks to seniors—LGBTQ seniors—about isolation and being in contact with them. And so mental health is just real important. And I'm glad see there's a lot of money in there for mental health services, because it's incredibly important. And at the same time, my community—the LGBTQ community—is under attack on a constant basis. And we need to—the trauma that's around there, we need to—needs to be addressed. And I'm hoping and praying that you will be able to sign into law the Equality Act. The President. So am I. Mr. Kerr. Thank you. Director Richmond. And last, but certainly not least, is Ms. Lyda Vanegas. Mary's Center Vice President of Marketing and Communications Lyda Vanegas. Well, first of all, thank you so much. Thank you for allowing Mary's Center—you know, on behalf of Mary's Center, being me here, you know, to share this story of the many, many families that we have served during this pandemic. [Ms. Vanegas continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] So, you know, it's this circle of situations that have been impacting all of our families. So, you know, with that comes mental health, trauma, anxiety. And our children don't have laptops. We have been able to distribute about 1,000 laptops or more. Ms. Williams. Very good. Ms. Vanegas. But you know, if they have one laptop, but they have three children, how can they all be in school on the same day? So they have to choose. Or they don't have internet connection. So there's a lot around that, and we've been trying to support as much as possible. The President. Well, thank you for—all of you for what you do. I carry a schedule card with me every day, and on back of the card, I list, on a daily basis, how many people have died from COVID in the United States. As of today, 517,224—not over 500,000; five thousand—517,224. And we will meet the 100 million shots. We're up to 82,572,848 shots. We're going to get this done. So I'm going to ask some questions now. The press is going to leave, and I'm going to get more personal with you, if I can, and ask some questions if it's okay."
"Mar 07, 2021","Videotaped Remarks at the Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast in Selma, Alabama","The President. Good afternoon. It's a good day today. You know, when we took office 45 days ago, I promised the American people that help was on the way. Today I can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise that help is on the way. I want to thank—start off by thanking the Vice President, but I want to thank all of the Senators who worked so hard to reach a compromise to do the right thing for the American people during this crisis and voted to pass the American Rescue Plan. It obviously wasn't easy, it wasn't always pretty, but it was so desperately needed, urgently needed. Also, I also need to say a few words about the Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who I spoke with many times on this and again this morning. I served in the Senate, as you all know, for many years. I've never seen anyone work as skillfully, as ably, as patiently, with determination, to deliver such a consequential piece of legislation that was so urgently needed as the American Rescue Plan. Chuck Schumer—Senator Chuck Schumer, when the country needed you most, you led, Chuck, and you delivered. Neither I nor the country will ever forget that. And it's not a moment too soon. I've been talking about the urgency of this need. For many—for over a year, the American people were told they were on their own. They were seeing—we've seen how hard that has been on so many Americans. As of last night, 519,064 lives lost to the virus. That many empty chairs this morning—the breakfast table—gone. More than 400 [400,000]* small businesses closed unnecessarily. Millions of people out of work through no fault of their own. I want to emphasize that: through no fault of their own. Food bank lines stretching for miles. Did any of you ever you'd see that in America, in cities all across this country? Families facing the threat of eviction. This Nation has suffered too much for much too long. And everything in this package is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgent needs of the Nation and put us in a better position to prevail, starting with beating this virus and vaccinating the country. The resources in this plan will be used to expand and speed up manufacturing and distribution of vaccines so we can get every single American vaccinated sooner than later. I believe by—we'll have enough by the end of—by the middle of May to vaccinate. It's going to take longer to take longer to get it in their arm, but that's how much vaccine we'll have. Because of all the funding, we'll be able to hire more vaccinators, set up more vaccination sites to get the country in a place to get back to normal. This plan will get checks out the door, starting this month, to the American people who so desperately need the help, many of whom are lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering: ""Will I lose my job, if I haven't already? Will I lose my insurance? Will I lose my home?"" Over 85 percent of American households will get direct payments of $1,400 per person. For a typical middle class family of four—husband and wife working, making $100,000 a year total, with three kids—they'll get $5,600—I mean, with two kids—will get $5,600, and it will be on the way soon. That means the mortgage can get paid. That means the child can stay in community college. That means maintaining the health insurance you have. It's going to make a big difference in so many of lives in this country. Unemployment benefits will be extended for 11 million Americans who have lost their jobs and who, last night, again were lying in bed, just thinking, ""My lord, I'm going to lose my unemployment insurance in a week or so."" It was about to expire. Schools are going to have the resources they need to open safely. States and local governments that have lost tens of thousands of essential workers will be—have the resources they need available to them, to those laid-off police officers, firefighters, teachers, and nurses they can rehire. They're our—these are essential personnel. Look, the American Rescue Plan lowers health care premiums. Food and nutrition assistance. It's hard to believe that 24 million adults and 11 million children, as I speak, in the United States suffer from food insecurity. That means, simply, they don't have enough food to eat. Did you ever imagine in the United States of America, you'd see lines, literally miles long—kids—folks in their automobiles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I stood in line, handing out food. The people coming up never, ever, ever thought they'd be in that position. This helps families who are behind on their rent and their mortgage payments so they aren't thrown out of their homes. Look, the bottom line is this: This plan puts us on the path to beating the virus. This plan gives those families who are struggling the most the help and the breathing room they need to get through this moment. This plan gives small businesses in this country a fighting chance to survive. And one more thing: This plan is historic. Taken altogether, this plan is going to make it possible to cut child poverty in half. Let me say that again—it's significant, historic—it will cut child poverty in half. There's much more to this bill, but for now, let me make one final point. When I was elected, I said we were going to get the Government out of the business of battling on Twitter and back in the business of delivering for the American people, of making a difference in their lives, giving everyone a chance—a fighting chance—of showing the American people that their Government can work for them. And passing the American Rescue Plan will do that. And you know, it may sound strange, but a lot of Senators and Congressmen I want to thank, but I really want to thank the American people for making all of this possible. You say, ""Well, how do they make it possible?"" Well, quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Your elected officials heard you. Overwhelming public support—every public opinion poll shows overwhelming support for this plan. And for the last weeks, it's shown that. Every public opinion poll shows the people want this, they believe it's needed, and they believe it's urgent. And now this bill returns to the House of Representatives, which has done a great job from the beginning, where I hope it will find quick passage so it can be sent to my desk to be signed into law. By passing the American Rescue Plan, we'll have heeded the voice of the American people, not ignored their voices. By passing this plan, we will have delivered real, tangible results for the American people and their families, and they'll be able to see and know and feel the change in their own lives. And by passing this plan, we'll have proved that this Government, this democracy can still work. What has to be done—it will improve people's lives. And one more thing: The vast majority of economists—left, right, and center—from Wall Street to the private economic polling initiatives, the economists—as I've said, left, right, and center—say, ""In addition to the needs the people have, we need this to grow the economy."" That if we haven't spent this money and recreated the kind of incentive for people to be able to make a good living, that we'd be in real trouble. This will create millions of new jobs—it's estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the Gross Domestic Product by a trillion dollars; put our Nation in a position to out-compete the rest of the world—because the rest of the world is moving, particularly China; and to know that as tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead. There really are. As I've said before, it's never a good bet to bet against America. It's never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We are America. We're going to get there. We're going to remain the leading economy in the world and going to be the most successful economy in the world because of you, the American people. Thank you, and God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, why couldn't you get a single Republican vote on this bill? What do you think the drama—— [At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.] The President's Agenda  Q. Why do you think you didn't get a single Republican vote, and what does the drama of the last 24 hours, including with Senator Manchin, tell you about the next 4 years? The President. They're going to be good. I'm going to succeed. We're going to succeed moving forward. Look, the American people strongly support what we're doing. That's the key here. And that's going to continue to seep down through the public, including from our Republican friends. There's a lot of Republicans that came very close. They've got a lot of pressure on them. I still haven't given up on getting their support. Thank you. Q. [Inaudible]—the compromises? The President. Pardon me? Economic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  Q. Your message to House Democrats who were frustrated with some of the compromises in the Senate bill, particularly—— The President. They're not frustrated. Bernie Sanders said this is the most progressive bill he's ever seen passed in history, since he's been here. And the compromises were all compromises that didn't affect the substance and the essence of what the bill is. Going from $300—from $400 to $300, to the unemployment excess. Well, it got extended until September. The end result is the essentially about the same. And so I don't think any of the compromises have in any way fundamentally altered the essence of what I put in the bill in the first place. Thank you."
"Mar 08, 2021",Remarks on International Women's Day and an Exchange With Reporters,"Good morning to everyone joining in this unity breakfast named after Dr. and Mrs. King and to commemorate the anniversary of the march in Selma. I know this is the first commemoration of Bloody Sunday without Reverend C.T. Vivian, Reverend Joseph Lowery, and Congressman John Lewis. Preachers of the social gospel. Architects of the ""Beloved Community,"" they built not only with words but with action. And reminders that in our lifetime, for Black Americans, the fundamental right to vote has been denied by White supremacy hiding both behind white hoods and in plain sight in statehouses and courtrooms. Yet those torches and burning crosses, the batons, tear gas, firehoses, attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could not stop progress. The blood of John Lewis and so many other brave and righteous souls that were spilled in Selma on this Sunday in 1965 sanctified a noble struggle. And when the country saw those images that night, America was forced to confront the denial of democracy, the fierce urgency of justice. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later, and President Johnson signed it into law. But the legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop free people from exercising their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do anything they can to take that power away. The Voting Rights Act began to dismantle barriers to voting and to make our elections more fair, free, and representative. I was always proud to lead the efforts to reauthorize it over the years as a U.S. Senator in the Judiciary Committee. But at the same time, Republicans at every level have chipped away at it. Then in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault that was taking place on the ground. The late Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like ""throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm."" Today, we have a hailstorm, not a rainstorm. A hailstorm. And in 2020, our very democracy on the line, even in the midst of a pandemic, more Americans voted than ever before. Multiple recounts in States and decisions in more than 60 cases—from judges appointed by my predecessor, including at the Supreme Court—upheld the integrity of this historic election. Instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting, we have seen an unprecedented insurrection in our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January the 6th. And never before—a never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people. And to think of that, and yet it's been followed by an all-out assault on the right to vote in State legislatures all across the country. During the current legislative sessions, elected officials in 43 States have already introduced over 250 bills to make it harder for Americans to vote. We cannot let them succeed. Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021. This is a landmark piece of legislation that is urgently needed to protect the right to vote, the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy. I hope the Senate does its work so that I can sign it into law. I also urge Congress to fully restore the Voting Rights Act, named in John Lewis's honor. Today, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I am signing an Executive order to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and improve access to voting. Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted. If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote. And I'll close with this: A few days before he passed, Jill and I spoke with John, Congressman Lewis. But instead of answering our concerns about him—we talked about ""how are you doing, John""—he asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal and to unite this Nation around what it means to be an American. That's the God's truth. John wouldn't talk about his pending death or his concerns. He said we've just got to get this done. That we are all created equal. That we all deserve to be treated equally. On this day of reflection, please, let's stay focused on the work ahead. Let's remember all those who came before us, as a bridge to our history so we don't forget its pain and as a bridge to our future so we never lose our hope. May God bless their memory, may God bless you all, and may God protect our forces."
"Mar 09, 2021",Remarks During a Tour of W.S. Jenks and Son,"The President. Thank you, Madam Vice President, and thank you, Mr. Secretary. On Friday, I submitted to the Senate for confirmation my first slate of nominations for four-star command positions in our Armed Forces, among them, two outstanding and eminently qualified warriors and patriots. General Jacqueline Van Ovost—and United States Air Force is currently the only female four-star officer serving in our military. I nominated her as Commander of the United States Transportation Command. And when confirmed, the Lieutenant General Laura Richardson, of the United States Army, will be promoted in rank and join General Van Ovost as the only four-star—as another four-star general. I nominated her as Commander in the United States Southern Command. And, when confirmed, they will become the second and third women in the history of the United States Armed Forces to lead combatant commands. Each of these women have led careers demonstrating incomparable skill, integrity, and duty to country. And at every step, they've also helped push open the doors of opportunity to women in our military, blazing the trail a little wider, a little brighter for all the proud women following in their path and looking to their example. And I wanted to shine the light on these accomplishments for those women today because General Van Ovost—as reiterated in an interview this last week, and I'm the second person to say this—it's hard to be what you can't see. It's hard to be what you can't see, but you'll soon see. Today is International Women's Day. And we all need to see and to recognize the barrier-breaking accomplishments of these women. We need the young women just beginning their careers in the military service to see it and know that no door will be closed to them. We need women and men throughout the ranks to see and celebrate women's accomplishments and leadership in the services. We need little girls and boys both, who have grown up dreaming of serving for their country, to know this is what generals in the United States Armed Forces look like. This is what Vice Presidents of United States look like. So I'd like to spend just a few minutes today making sure that America knows who General Van Ovost is and Lieutenant General Richardson is. They're aviators. Both learned to fly planes before they were old enough to drive a car. General Van Ovost, a first-generation—is a first-generation American: the daughter of Dutch immigrants who owned a flying operation. She loved the freedom of flight and, as a teenager, flew herself to see Sally Ride lift off as the first woman in space. [Laughter] Sixteen years old, goes down to see Sally Ride. She said she was at several thousand feet watching from a distance. You know, women weren't—were banned from flying combat missions when the general joined the force, so she focused on becoming a test pilot. And instead of learning to fly just one plane, she learned to fly everything, including Air Force Two when I was Vice President. General Van Ovost currently is—oversees Air Mobility Command: approximately 107,000 airmen and 1,100 planes that enable America's air power and humanitarian assistance to go everywhere in the world it need be. From flying water to Texas after the recent storms to ensuring our wounded warriors are evacuated for medical care from anywhere in the world, she gets it done. Lieutenant General Richardson's parents were proud patriots. It must have rubbed off because Lieutenant General Richardson and her brother and sister all joined the Army. Her father encouraged her to join ROTC in college, even though that meant commuting to a different school. When Lieutenant General Richardson joined the Army Aviation Branch, women were banned from flying attack helicopters. She flew to—in support of combatant—combat missions, and conducting lift operations of her UH-1—the so-called ""Huey""—and the Blackhawks. Now, as the commanding general of the United States Army North, Lieutenant General Richardson oversees military ground responses here in North America. All over the last year, that's meant getting military and medical personnel deployed to help in our response to this pandemic. More than 4,500 military medical personnel deployed in hospitals across 14 States and the Navajo Nation to treat COVID-19 patients. It means more than 2,200 medical personnel are working, or soon will be, at vaccination sites in eight States and the United States Virgin Islands. I'm so proud of the incredible work Lieutenant General Richardson and her team have done to support the American people this year, and the American people are as well. They're warriors. They're crisis-tested commanders. And best of all—best of all—they're not done yet. Neither of these incredible generals is resting on her laurels or on her stars. They're using their voices and actively working to change policies in the military to make it easier and safer for more women not just to join the military, but to stay in the military and to thrive. I'm incredibly proud that in 2015, under the Obama-Biden administration, we took the final steps to open up all positions in the military to anyone qualified to serve in them. The women who join today's military aren't told ""no"" when they apply to fly fighter jets or attack helicopters just because of their gender. They aren't told ""no"" when they want to apply to Ranger School or infantry officer basic training. But they all know that there's much, much more work to be done to ensure that women's leadership is recognized and we have more diverse leaders; we reach the top echelons of command for all who are qualified, including all women—all women; and that all women feel safe and respected in our military—period. You know, some of it is relatively straightforward work where we're making good progress designing body armor that fits women properly; tailoring combat uniforms for women; creating maternity flight suits; updating requirements for their hairstyles. And some of it is going to take—and—you know, an intensity of purpose and mission to really change the culture and habits that cause women to leave the military: That women are—making sure more diverse candidates are considering—being considered for career-advancing opportunities at every single level. That women aren't penalized in their careers for having children. That women aren't just token members, but integral parts throughout all branches and all divisions. And that they can completely, fairly engage in promotion and compete all across the board, including on the—on age and gender neutrality and physical fitness test. You know that both members of the military couples can thrive while serving, like Lieutenant General Richardson and her husband, Lieutenant General Richardson, who, I might add, I want to thank you for getting me off a mountain that was about 12- to 14,000 feet up on a goat path when our helicopter went down in a snowstorm. And it's good to see you, General. The ride down that mountain was more perilous in a truck than it was in the helicopter, but thank you. And we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against women in the military. Sexual assault is abhorrent and wrong at any time. And in our military, where so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow servicemembers to have your back, there's nothing less than a threat to our national security. I know Secretary Austin takes this as seriously as Vice President Harris and I do. That's why his first memo as Secretary was a directive to take on sexual assault in the military and why he stepped up independent review—he set up an Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault to make concrete recommendations for changes. This is going to be an all-hands-on-deck effort under my administration to end the scourge of sexual assault in the military. And we're going to be focused on that from the very top. I know that we can do it. The U.S. Military has defeated American enemies on land, in air, and at sea, and this is not beyond us. I want to thank General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson for their exemplary careers and service to our country. You're America's patriotism at its finest: undaunted and absolutely—absolutely able to do anything by any obstacle; determined to open wide and the doors of opportunity; and ready for the next challenge. It's my great honor to serve as your Commander in Chief. And I look forward to hearing your Active Duty and recommendations of how we will work together to keep the American people safe to meet every challenge in the 21st century. So I want to thank you both. And I want to thank the former general—I keep calling him ""General."" But my—the guy who runs that outfit over there. I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we've just talked about, and for recommending these two women for promotion. Thank you all, may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. [Inaudible]—you don't have to speak. [Laughter] Thank you, everybody. Voting Rights Legislation  Q. Mr. President, can you pass voting rights with the Senate filibuster in its current form, do you think? The President. I can talk to you about that later. Q. What about these votes against transgender youth?"
"Mar 10, 2021",Remarks Announcing a Collaboration Agreement by Johnson and Johnson and Merck and Company on COVID-19 Vaccine Production and an Exchange With Reporters,"W.S. Jenks and Son co-owner Michael Siegel. So this is our main showroom in the store. You can see a lot of our employees up top there. The President. Hey, everybody. How are you? Participants. Hi! The President. It's good to see you. Mr. Siegel. We are DC's oldest hardware store. We've been continuously operating in this city since 1866. We've moved around a few times. We've been in this building for 7 years now. Like my father was telling you, this is actually our second Presidential visit, but our first one in this building. So welcome. We're excited to have you here today. And we want to introduce you to Mary Ackley, from Little Wild Things. She has a separate business in our building. What they do is microgreens. And I'll turn it over to Mary because she can describe her business a lot better than I'll be able to. The President. Fire away, Mary. Little Wild Things Farm Founder and Chief Veggie Officer Mary Anna Ackley. [Laughter] Sure. We moved here a few years ago, and we are an urban vertical farm located right next door. We grow salad greens, microgreens, and edible flowers. Beautiful salads. We deliver them all over the greater Washington, DC, area, both to homes, and we donate locally here in the neighborhood. The President. Now, you've been engaged in the neighborhood too. You sponsor a Little League team, don't you? Mr. Siegel. We do. We sponsor a Little League team. We also—we run job fairs for special needs programs to get their students—to help them find employment. We've actually hired three people from those—from that job program. It's called ""Project SEARCH."" It's a partnership between a nonprofit and the DC government, and they do a great job training their students, who are special needs, to come and be able to work in an environment like this and be great contributors. The President. Have you hired any of those folks? Mr. Siegel. We've hired three. The President. Three? Mr. Siegel. Yes. The President. I'll be darned. Mr. Siegel. And Mary participated in our first job fair. We were going to do another one, but obviously, the pandemic has halted our ability to do that. But when things go back to normal, we're going to continue to do those job fairs. The President. Tell me, what kind of—what hit you the hardest when the pandemic hit? Mr. Siegel. Right. So the biggest challenge is what were we going to do with our staff. You know, there were so many uncertainties related to what the virus actually did. The first thing that we did was we took all of our at-risk employees, and we sent them home, and we paid them through that entire process. That first wave of PPP loans was very helpful to allow us to do that. Obviously, that was not cost effective, but we felt like we had to do that for our employees. You know, and we're still struggling because we did—a lot of retail business has actually increased over the course of the pandemic. I think people know there's a little bit of hardware boom. A big portion of our business is actually Government sales and commercial sales. And, for the first 4 or 5 months, I mean, that was completely gone. And honestly, usually, it's about 60 percent of our annual revenue. The President. Well, one of the reasons why I changed the rule for—it was 20 days—to make sure only employers that had 20 or fewer employees could qualify for PPP. And the reason for that was, 400,000 small businesses went out of business. They got in line, but they couldn't get the help. And we found out that an awful lot of that went to big—bigger businesses that, in fact, weren't supposed to qualify for this. Because they—there used be a thing called an ""inspector general"" to see where the money went. And the last administration fired the inspector general, so a lot of money went to people who shouldn't have gotten help, and it didn't go to folks who—but you know, the significance with this new program—and we're going to continue this, by the way—it's not only—you've been—only businesses with fewer than 20 folks could apply for the last couple weeks. But now we're going to keep the focus on it because there's a lot of minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses are increased significantly by 20, 15—20 and 15 percent, as well as getting people who, in fact, weren't able to get in line before. And it's hard to know how to get in line. And so I hope this is going to continue to increase, because we're also at the point where I think we're going to begin to gain control of this virus. Mr. Siegel. Yes, I—and we appreciate your leadership on that. One quick point I want to make is that: I said we're the oldest hardware store in DC; I also say we're the greenest hardware store in America. We have two urban farms actually in our building. We have Mary, who is in the garage there, and then we have Cultivate the City, which is an awesome rooftop garden. They exist on our rooftop. But you can't—you're not going to be able to see it from here, but if they want to give a wave. The President. I see them. Mr. Siegel. Yes. Participants. Hi! Mr. Siegel. Yes, and then we also have solar panels—— The President. Don't jump; we need you. [Laughter] Mr. Siegel. And then, if I could just—— Q. Mr. President, is there a crisis at the border? [At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.] Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]. Q. Is there a crisis at the border, sir?"
"Mar 11, 2021",Remarks on Signing the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"The President. I want to thank you both for those words. You know, you and I knew one another when I wasn't a President and you weren't a chairman. Merck and Co., Inc., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth C. Frazier. Right. [Laughter] The President. We'd ride back and forth on Amtrak. You lived in Philadelphia; I was commuting to Wilmington. It's good to see you both here. And thank both of you for your kind words. And I want to thank the scientists and researchers at Johnson and Johnson for the literal heroic effort that began when COVID-19 first spread and led to the safe and effective vaccine that are now being coproduced. Today we're seeing two health companies—competitors—each with over 130 years of experience, coming together to help write a more hopeful chapter in our battle against COVID-19. I just had an opportunity to meet with both of these CEOs and with their senior operating officers and to hear about the work they're doing together to produce vaccine substitute [substance]* and accelerate what they call to take it to full finish [fill finish]*. You know, what's clear is, this is a historic, nearly unprecedented collaboration. During World War II, one of the country's slogans was ""We are all in this together."" ""We are all in this together."" And companies took that slogan to heart. For example, one automaker didn't have the capacity to build enough jeeps; a competitor stepped in to help. Competing airline makers teamed up, and they produced parts for each other and gave the American pilots, as a consequence of that, control of the skies. Today we're seeing the same type of collaboration when it comes to getting this virus under control. I said we ought to treat this like a war. So I want to thank the two companies for showing how we can come together to defeat this virus by putting patriotism and public health first. And I mean that literally, putting patriotism and public health first. Your companies have been working closely with a man you've both privately, on the way over, bragged about: Jeff Zients. Jeff is in the front row here. I want to thank you, Jeff, and the entire COVID team you put together for the coordination of our COVID-19 response; and Dr. David Kessler and his team at the Department of Health and Human Services. You know, when we came into office, we began working with the team at J&J to accelerate and add capacity to their manufacturing and production efforts. And it quickly became clear that Merck—one of the world's leading vaccine manufacturers—was in a position to be the partner we needed in this effort—in this wartime effort. I've not hesitated to use my power under the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. And it's not just Johnson and Johnson and Merck; Pfizer, Moderna also worked closely with us to help speed up the delivery of millions of more doses. The result is that we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May, months earlier than anyone expected. And today I am directing Jeff and my HHS team to produce another 100 million doses and purchase another 100 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'm doing this because, in this wartime efforts, we need maximum flexibility. There is always a chance that we'll encounter unexpected challenges or we'll—there will be a new need for a vaccine effort—or vaccination effort. A lot can happen, a lot can change, and we need to be prepared. And of course, we need to match the miracle of science and the skill of manufacturing with the massive logistical undertaking of vaccinating over 300 million Americans. Already, we have gone from Johnson and Johnson vaccine authorization to shots in the arm in 3 days. I was telling the gentlemen, we were at a facility yesterday—a veterans outreach—and there were four—or there were three members of the veterans community getting shots. One was getting—of each of the three vaccines. And the guy in the middle, a veteran, was getting his. And I was standing about as far away as I am from you and standing up, and he was sitting down. And as the nurse put it in his arm, he went, ""J&J, just one."" [Laughter] Well, there's millions of people who are going to feel that way and be proud to have—be in a position that they have—an ability to get the kind of help they need. Seven weeks ago, only 8 percent of the seniors—those most vulnerable to COVID-19—had received the vaccination. Today, 60 percent of the people over the age of 65 or older have received at least one shot. And that's because this is the population that represents 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths. We've opened support and opened—excuse me—and supported more than 500 community vaccination sites. That's more—and they're administrating hundreds of thousands of shots a day. And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we're deploying mobile clinics, like vans, that go into places to meet the folks where they live. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been hit the hardest and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. And this is important because we know we have more to do to ensure everyone is treated with equity and those most impacted get the care they deserve. On Saturday, we hit a record of 2.9 million vaccinations in 1 day in America. And beyond the numbers are the stories: a father who says he no longer fears for his daughter when she leaves to go to work at the hospital; the children who are now able to hug their grandparents. The vaccines bring hope and healing in so many ways. Again, a vaccinated American is the only way to beat the pandemic, get our economy back on track, and for us to get back our lives and our loved ones. You know, that's why the American Rescue Plan was so critical. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives today for passing the bill, and I will be signing it into law shortly. This bill represents a historic—a historic—victory for the American people. And I look forward to signing it later this week. Everything in the American Rescue Plan addresses a real need, including investments to fund our entire vaccination effort: more vaccines, more vaccinators, and more vaccinations sites. Millions more Americans will get tested, including home testing. Schools will soon have the funding and resources to reopen safely—a national imperative. The American Rescue Plan, the partnership between Johnson and Johnson and Merck, proves we can do big things, important things in this country. Now, I'll—let me conclude with this: Tomorrow night I'm going on primetime to address the American people and talk about what we went through as a Nation this past year. But more importantly, I'm going to talk about what comes next. I'm going to launch the next phase of the COVID response and explain what we will do as a Government and what we will ask of the American people. There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable. Together, we're going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future. So there is real reason for hope, folks. There's real reason for hope, I promise you. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God ease the pain in the heart of so many who have lost so many people in this pandemic. Thank you, and I really—we're going to do this. We're going to get it done. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, what do you plan to do with the surplus? What will you do with the surplus? National Supply of COVID-19 Vaccine Doses/International Cooperation Efforts  Q. Mr. President, when will you do a press conference? The President. The surplus will—if we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world. We've already decided we're going to work with the outfit COVAX—we've committed $4 billion to help get the funding for more vaccines around the world. This is not something that can be stopped by a fence, no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we're not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe. And so we're going to start making sure Americans are taken care of first, but we're then going to try and help the rest of the world. Thank you. Q. Is there a price for—[inaudible]? Q. [Inaudible]—no Republicans voted for it?"
"Mar 11, 2021",Address to the Nation on the First Anniversary of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Thank you for coming in. In the weeks that this bill has been discussed and debated, it's clear that an overwhelming percentage of the American people—Democrats, Independents, our Republican friends—have made it clear—the people out there made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan. Yesterday, with the final passage of the plan in the House of Representatives, their voices were heard and reflected in everything we have in this bill. And I believe this is—and most people, I think, do as well—this historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this Nation—working people and middle class folks, the people who built the country—a fighting chance. That's what the essence of it is. And I'm going to have a lot more to say about that tonight and in the next couple of days, and be able to take your questions. But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is sign this bill and make the presentation tonight. And then, there's going to be plenty of opportunities where we're going to be on the road, not only talking about—what I'm talking about tonight is the impact on the virus and how we're going to end this pandemic. And we're going to talk all the elements of the bill, beginning Friday and Saturday and through the week. So thank you for being here. [At this point, the President signed the bill.] Got it. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Q. Mr. President, what's next? What's next after this?"
"Mar 12, 2021","Remarks With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Leaders Virtual Summit","The President. Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight I'd like to talk to you about where we are as we mark 1 year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness. Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us. But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do. And that's what we've done. We've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives—sometimes losing them—to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. I know it's been hard. I truly know. As I've told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It's on the back of my schedule. As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors—young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral. But I'm also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other disease. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave behind loved ones who are hurting badly. You know, you've often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say: ""I'm sorry, but I lost my job. Can't be here anymore."" Like my dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton. So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year. You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and maybe worst of all, a loss of hope. Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more—because they've not been in school—because of their loss of learning. It's the details of life that matter most, and we've missed those details, the big details and small moments: weddings, birthdays, graduations—all the things that needed to happen, but didn't. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals. It's all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others: to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another. But this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven't seen their kids. Kids haven't seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn't do and broke our hearts. Too often, we've turned against one another. A mask—the easiest thing to do to save lives—sometimes, it divides us. States pitted against one other instead of working with each other. Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them—our fellow Americans—they're on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still—still—they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop. Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our Government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people—no function more important. We need to remember, the Government isn't some foreign force in a distant Capital. No, it's us. All of us. ""We the People."" For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you. Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner—a woman. I asked her—I said, ""What do you need most?"" I'll never forget what she said to me. She said—looking me in the eye, she said: ""I just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth."" Think of that. My fellow Americans, you're owed nothing less than the truth. And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You've been hearing me say that for—while I was running and the last 50 days I've been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we've ever undertaken as a nation in a long time. That's why I'm using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing. And thank God we're making some real progress now. In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we've spent every day since attempting to carry it out. Two months ago, the country—this country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or anywhere near all of the American public. But soon we will. We've been working with the vaccine manufacturers—Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson—to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson and Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is one shot. In fact, just yesterday I announced—and I met with the CEOs of both companies—I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccines. These two companies—competitors—have come together for the good of the Nation, and they should be applauded for it. It's truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now, because of all the work we've done, we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That's months ahead of schedule. And we're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm. Calling on Active Duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots. And we've been creating more places to get the shots. We've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one—any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot. And we're also working with Governors and mayors, in red States and blue States, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administers hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour. We've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we've been deploying—and we will deploy more—mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it. We continue to work on making at-home testing available. And we've been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic: Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. So what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months—only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 have gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly]* 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent. With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC]* will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends, and as well as travel. When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office. Tonight I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we're going to beat that goal. Because we're actually on track to reach this goal of a hundred million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None. Now I want to talk about the next steps we're thinking about. First, tonight I'm announcing that I will direct all States, Tribes, and Territories to make all adults—people 18 and over—eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected. Let me be clear: That doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately, but it means you'll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot. And, to do this, we're going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining—beating our current pace of 2 million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world. Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan—and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it—and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about a hundred million shots, of opening the majority of K-through-8 schools in my first hundred days in office. This is going to be the number-one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona. Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated. And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that's not hyperbole. I need you. I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well. Because here's the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn't mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together. After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus. But to get there, we can't let our guard down. This fight is far from order—from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, ""I will tell you the truth."" A July 4 with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal—a lot can happen; conditions can change. The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. And we've got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines. So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He's assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they're safe. Vice President Harris and I know they're safe. That's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so—for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated. Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors—the people you know best who've gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC. Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. And national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don't want to do again. We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules. I'll close with this. We've lost so much over the last year. We've lost family and friends. We've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We've lost time, time with each other. And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies. You know, and there's something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our Government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we're proving once again something I have said time and time again until they're probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It's never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back. The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another. And today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks—payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check—a Treasury check. It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it funds all the steps I've just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs. In the coming weeks and months, I'll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman, and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any place, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not. About how after a long, dark years—1 whole year—there is hope and light of better days ahead. If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything—hard things, big things, important things. Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now we're coming through it, and it's a shared experience that binds us together as a Nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us. My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we'll come together as one people, one Nation, one America. I believe we can, and we will. We're seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this Nation's history, darkest we've ever known. I promise you, we'll come out stronger, with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country. This is the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—from the bottom of my heart, I believe this—there is nothing we can't do when we do it together. So God bless you all. And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone. And may God protect our troops. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you. Q. President Biden, do you consider this a new phase of the pandemic?"
"Mar 12, 2021",Remarks on the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"President Biden. Hello, everyone. I wish we were able to do this in person, but it's wonderful to gather with friends even—even in this virtual format. We're reminded that we're in the midst of a global crisis, but we're going to overcome that as well. The Quad group is—was created in the wake of, as you just—everyone just saw on that short film—in the wake of a crisis under my predecessor George W. Bush, on the two-oh-four—the 2004 tsunami. I remember later, Mr. Prime Minister, in Japan, going and visiting that—the aftermath of that. It was devastating what you all went through. And for the first time, we're convening this group as—at a leader level. And I want to thank my counterparts for joining me today: Prime Minister Morrison and Modi and Suga. You—it's good to have you all. Like I said, I wish we were doing this together. The—it's also the first multilateral summit that I've had the opportunity to host as President. And on this—and on this moment, it's a purpose that I think we all are concerned about: a free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to each of our futures, our countries. The United States is committed to working with you, our partners, and all our allies in the region to achieve stability. And this is a group of—particularly important because it's dedicated to the practical solutions and concrete results. And, my counterparts, if you'll forgive me, I'd like to give one example of why it matters. There are many examples, but yesterday I signed into law the American Rescue Plan to get the American people through this pandemic and kick start our economy and our economic recovery. It's a bill that will get meaningful help into the hands of people in our country who need it the most. Consequently, this week, the OECD revised up its expected rate of growth for the United States this year as a consequence of that legislation. In fact, it doubled it from 3.2 percent to 6.5 percent; the fastest rate in 1-year economic growth since 1984. And it's critical because the OECD also predicted that the United States economic growth, fueled by the ARP and increased vaccinations, will be a key driver in global growth this year and our trade partners benefiting around the world as a consequence. But to get this right, we all have to focus on generating domestic demand and driving sustainable global growth. And we've—launching an ambitious new joint partnership that is going to boost vaccine manufacturing, and—for the global benefit—and strengthen vaccinations to benefit the entire Indo-Pacific. We're establishing a new mechanism to enhance our cooperation and raise our mutual ambitions as we address accelerating climate change. And we're renewing our commitment to ensure that our region is governed by international law, committed to upholding universal values, and free from coercion. We've got a big agenda ahead of us, gentlemen, as you well know, but I'm optimistic about our prospects. The Quad is going to be a vital arena for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. And I look forward to working closely with all of you in the coming years. And now, Prime Minister Modi, I'm kicking it over to you. And again, it's great to see you. [At this point, Prime Minister Modi spoke via videoconference from New Delhi, India.] Prime Minister Modi. Your Excellencies President Biden, Prime Minister Morrison, and Prime Minister Suga: It is good to be among the friends. I thank President Biden for this initiative. Excellencies, we are united by our democratic values and our commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Our agenda today—covering areas like vaccines, climate change, and emerging technologies—make the Quad a force for global good. I see this positive vision as an extension of India's ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which regards the world as one family. We will work together, closer than ever before, for advancing our shared values and promoting a secure, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Today's summit meeting shows that Quad has come of age. It will now remain an important pillar of stability in the region. Thank you. President Biden. Thank you. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. Prime Minister Morrison. [Prime Minister Morrison spoke via videoconference from Sidney, Australia.] Prime Minister Morrison. President Biden, for this wonderful initiative and bringing us together. And my fellow Prime Ministers, it's great to see you. Namaste. Good morning. Konnichiwa. And from Australia, g'day. As we begin a new day here in Australia, it's not yet dawn. But we join together as Quad leaders of nations to welcome what I think will be a new dawn in the Indo-Pacific through our gathering. History teaches us that when nations engage together in a partnership of strategic trust, of common hope, and shared values, much can be achieved. When the world emerged from the Great War and our last global pandemic a century ago, it soon found a Great Depression and another global conflict that unleashed a poverty and a devastation that was unthinkable. As we emerge from this global pandemic and the global recession, let us together create a different future. It is the Indo-Pacific that will now shape the destiny of our world in the 21st century. As four leaders of great, liberal democracies in the Indo-Pacific, let our partnership be the enabler of peace, stability, and prosperity, and to do so inclusively with the many nations of our region to share in their vision, as expressed through ASEAN, for an open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific; to respect and support their sovereignty, independence, and security by upholding our values and supporting international law; and to address the many challenges we face, from COVID to climate change. Know, friends, that Australia, while looking to our friends in all of these tasks, we never leave it to our friends. We'll do our share of the heavy lifting to lighten the burden for us all. I'm delighted to now hand over to my good friend Yoshi, Prime Minister Suga. [Prime Minister Suga spoke via videoconference from Tokyo, Japan.] Prime Minister Suga. Joe, Mr. Modi, and ScoMo: It is a great honor to realize the Japan-Australia-India-U.S. leaders' summit with all of you, working together to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. Starting with the response to the tsunami disaster that we just saw on the video, the Quad four countries transformed into a forum for diplomatic dialogue in 2007. Since then, after overcoming some difficult circumstances from around 2017, we gained a fresh momentum. In October, last year, we reached the stage of holding the Foreign Ministers meeting here in Tokyo. Less than half a year since then, we are now holding this first leaders' summit. And I do feel emotional about the development. I thank Joe for your initiative. With the four countries working together, I wish to firmly advance our cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and to make visible and tangible contribution to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the region, including overcoming COVID-19. Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake. We received massive support from the U.S., Australia, and India in our response to the disaster. Joe visited the affected areas soon after the disaster. And I thank you once again. I look forward to a fruitful discussion today."
"Mar 15, 2021",Remarks on the Implementation of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and an Exchange With Reporters,"Good afternoon. Thank you, Kamala. You know, when I look out over what happened the last 50 days when Jill and I first got a chance to move into this magnificent building behind you, I promised the American people—and I guess this is becoming an overused phrase—that help was on the way. But today, with the American Rescue Plan now signed into law, we've delivered on that promise. And I don't mean I've delivered; we've delivered. Look out there on all of you. Patty, there would still be people, kids in poverty, were it not for all the work you did all those years. And I want to say to Bernie: Bernie, stepping up and making the case why this was so transformational made a big difference in how a lot of people voted. I look out at all of you, House Members as well, who have made the case to the American people why this is so important. I watched my buddy, Jim, down in South Carolina, stand up and talk about how it's going to affect individual people. I have a—my inclination is to mention every single one of you, because I think I've called most of you and thanked you already for what you did. I even called Pallone. He wasn't there though; he was on the other side of the river. [Laughter] We joke all the time. He's in—he's in New Jersey; I'm in Delaware. I keep reminding him Delaware owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I want to thank you all. I want to thank, particularly, the Speaker, who, from day one—from the very first day I got the nomination—was supportive in ways that are hard for me to describe. And you know, I served a long time in the United States Senate, longer than anybody for—still there at the time, other than Pat. If I were still in the Senate, I'd be Senate pro tem because I was 2 years ahead of Pat. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, we've still got a lot of great majority leaders. But I never saw anybody handle such a controversial, consequential piece of legislation that was right on the edge than Chuck Schumer. I owe you, Chuck. You did an incredible job. And look—and to the Members of the House and Senate, thanks for making this happen. You made it happen. As I said, I served 36 years in the Senate. I know how hard it is to pass major consequential legislation, particularly when we only have such minor, small majorities in both Houses, Steny. You've done an incredible job. And, Nancy and Chuck, I have to say that I agree with many of the columnists that have commented on this legislation: What you shepherded through the Congress not only meets the moment, it does even more. It's historical, and they call it transformational. And it really is. The bill was supported overwhelmingly by the American people—Democrats, Independents, and Republicans—and had a strong support of Governors and mayors across the country in both parties—red States and blues. Over 430 mayors contacted me, many of them Republicans, supporting the bill. And here's why: Because what you all did with it and the refinements you made, it directly addressed the emergency in this country, because it focuses on what people need most. Debbie and I often talked about: You've got to tell people in plain, simple, straightforward language what it is you're doing to help. You've got to be able to tell a story, tell the story of what you're about to do and why it matters because it's going to make a difference in the lives of millions of people and in very concrete, specific ways. This legislation, as everybody has already mentioned, will provide $1,400 in direct payments, which we all promised. Well, that means for a typical family of four—a middle-class family, husband and wife working, making $110,000 a year—that means a $5,600 check they're going to get. Eighty-five percent of the households in America will be getting this money. And a lot of you know—because of the way you came up like I did and others—what that can mean. Think of the millions of people going to sleep at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking: ""My god, what am I going to do tomorrow? I've lost my health care. I don't have a job. Unemployment runs out. I'm behind on my mortgage. What are we going to do?"" Well, guess what? They're going to be getting quite—that check soon, either by direct deposit or a check from the Treasury. And they're going to—some are going to get it as early as this weekend. This legislation provides resources needed to open our schools. How many of you have dealt not only in your own home and with your children and grandchildren, if you have them, with how difficult it is, the mental pressure and stress that are on so many families? So many people needing help—if they had access to counseling—because it's caused an enormous, enormous stress. This legislation extends unemployment insurance by $300 a week until September. It's going to help 11 million Americans who were days from losing that benefit. This legislation includes the biggest investment in childcare since World War II. That's not hyperbole, that's just a fact. It's a fact. It provides help for small businesses to stay open. And you know, 400,000—so many have had to close because, the first time around, you all worked and did a great piece of work, and the House passed a significant legislation. What's the first thing the last President—he fired the folks who were supposed to watch and make sure it got, in fact, distributed the way it was supposed to. We find out so much of it went to people who didn't need it. You all took care of that. It extends coverage and lowers health care costs for so many Americans—so many Americans. And it's a big number for people. It provides for food and nutrition. Because people knew—and you all were out there handing out food like many of us were, but you saw people who were in car lines that were literally miles long. You'd see four lanes of cars that went back for a half a mile each, just to get a box of food. Again, through no fault of their own. It's going to help people keep a roof over their heads. A half million are—haven't been able to make their mortgage payments, about to be thrown out of their apartments. They have to make up all that they owe. And those mom-and-pop realtors are in real trouble. It's going to cut job poverty in half with—and you know, I've talked to so many of you. Rosa, you and I've spent so much time on this. But you guys—you, Patty, and others—are the ones that have been leading this for so long, and it's finally coming to fruition. And the American people understand it. It pays for many of the steps we've taken on—to vaccinate Americans. We're going to be in a position where, because of what you all did in the past, we had the money to go out and literally purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines and then go out and make sure we had enough vaccinators. Vaccine is one thing. To get the vaccine in a vial, out of that vial and into a needle, and a needle into someone's arm, it took tens of thousands of people. And because of you, we were able to mobilize the military. We were able to mobilize FEMA. We were able—I was able, by Executive order, to allow former docs and nurses to come back and be able to engage in this activity. And one of the things that we said in the beginning that no one thought that I was being straight about was, I said this is going to create—we have to spend this money to make sure we have economic growth, unrelated to how much it's going to help people. Well, guess what? Every single major economist out there—left, right, and center—supported this plan. Even Wall Street agreed. According to Moody's, for example, by the end of this year, this law alone will create 7 million new jobs. Seven million. And the bill, it does one more thing, which I think is really important: It changes the paradigm. For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this Nation first. It's not hyperbole, it's a fact. For too long, it's been the folks at the top. They're not bad folks. A significant number of them know they shouldn't be getting the tax breaks they had. But it put the richest Americans first, who benefited the most. And the theory was—we've all heard it, and especially the last 15 years. The theory was: Cut taxes, and those at the top and the benefits they get will trickle down to everyone. Well, you saw what trickle down does. We've known it for a long time. But this is the first time we've been able to, since the Johnson administration and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm. We've seen time and time again that that trickle down does not work. And by the way, we don't have anything against wealthy people. You've got a great idea, you're going to go out and make millions of dollars, that's fine. I have no problem with that. But guess what? You've got to pay your fair share. You've got to pay some. Because guess what? Folks who are making—living on the edge, they're paying. And so, again, all it's done is make those at the top richer in the past, and everyone else falling behind. This time, it's time that we build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out—the middle out. And this bill shows that when you do that, everybody does better. The wealthy do better. Everybody does better across the board. If that's our foundation, then everything we build upon will be strong—a strong foundation: our competitiveness around the world, the jobs here at home, the health and quality of our lives. That's what the American Rescue Plan represents, and it's all about rebuilding what I've been saying, and Bernie and a lot of others are saying—the backbone of this country. The backbone of this country are hard-working folks. Hard-working folks. Middle class folks. People who built the country. And I might add, I think, unions built the middle class. And it's about creating opportunity and giving people a fair shot. That's really all and everything it's about. In the coming weeks, Jill and I and Kamala and Doug and our Cabinet, with all of you—Members of Congress—we're going to be traveling the country to speak directly to the American people about how this law is going to make a real difference in their lives and how help is here for them. Almost every single aspect would be significant—would be every—if you took the piece of this bill and broke it into all of the pieces, every one of those pieces standing alone would be viewed as a significant accomplishment. But it's all the work you've done for years to try to get us there. This law is not the end of our efforts though. I view it as only the beginning. As we—look, one of the things that I've been most worried about, and I think you all have too—especially those of us who've been around for a hundred years, like me—[laughter]—is you've watched people lose confidence in government. Just lose confidence in that we tell the truth. That's why, when I announced, I quoted Franklin Roosevelt. He said, ""I'll give it to you straight from the shoulder."" The American people can handle anything if you tell them the truth. And they really can. Just give it straight from the shoulder. And when we do something right, we're going to make a case for it. And when I make a mistake, I'm going to own up to it and say: ""It was me. I made a mistake."" And I said last night: This is not over. Conditions can change. We're not finished yet. Conditions can change. The scientists have warned us about new variants of this virus. And the devil is in the details of implementing this legislation. I know from experience when the President turned to me—like I haven't done to the Vice President yet—and said: ""Take care of it. You take care of implementing the plan."" [Laughter] But she could do it. But I remember being—given the dubious distinction of having to implement a Recovery Act back in—when we came into office, Barack and I. I spent literally 4 or 5 hours a day, for 6 months. I talked to over 160 mayors probably more than two or three times; every Governor, save one, who was looking at—from Alaska to Russia—and making sure that we're in a situation where we talk to everybody. But it takes—the devil is in the details. It's one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan. It's going to be another thing to implement it. It's going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there's no waste or fraud and the law does what it's designed to do. And I mean it: We have to get this right. Details matter, because we have to continue to build confidence in the American people that their government can function for them and deliver. So there's a lot of work for all of us left to do, but I know we'll do it. To every American watching: Help is here, and we will not stop working for you. Together, with you, we are showing it's possible to get big, important things done. That's what America does. It tackles hard problems. And how we do—you know, look, it's how we do have it within ourselves to come out of this moment, which we've been saying—a lot of us have been saying for a long time, more prosperous, more united, and stronger than we went in. That's where we have a chance to be. That's what we're going to be able to do. And it's really critical—and it's really critical—to demonstrate not Democrat/Republican; it's critical to demonstrate that government can function—can function and deliver prosperity, security, and opportunity for the people in this country. And as my grandfather used to kiddingly say, ""With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising,"" that's exactly what we're going to do. God bless you all. Thanks for all you did. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. I wish I could come out and shake hands with every one of you. But next time, it won't be so far apart. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it."
"Mar 16, 2021","Remarks at Smith Flooring Incorporated in Chester, Pennsylvania","The President. Good afternoon. When I signed the American Rescue Plan last week, I said, ""Help is on the way."" This week—and I can report—this isn't just on the way, it's here, sooner than many ever thought possible. Over the next 10 days, we'll reach two goals—two giant goals. The first is, 100 million shots in people's arms will have been completed within the next 10 days, and 100 million checks in people's pockets in the next 100 [10]* days. Shots in arms and money in pockets—that's important. The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people's everyday lives. And we're just getting started. By the time all the money is distributed, 85 percent of American households will have gotten a $1,400 rescue checks. To give more—to give one more example: For the average family of two parents and two children making a combined income of $110,000 a year, that's going to add $5,600 for them—$5,600 they'll get. And the plan does a lot more. It extends unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans unemployed and any who will be unemployed in the near term. It will help hundreds of thousands of small businesses keep their doors open, which makes a gigantic difference in neighborhoods and communities. If you have a drugstore, if you have a beauty shop, a hardware store, it's the center of small communities. And it gets our schools and—resources they need to open safely. It provides the biggest investment in childcare since World War II. And it provides food and nutrition help for the millions of families to keep them from going hungry, keeping a roof over their heads. And it expands health care coverage and lowers health care costs for so many people. And it will cut child poverty in half in this country. That's the estimate: Child poverty will be cut in half as a consequence of what's in this recovery act. And it will generate economic growth for the entire Nation. That's why major economists—left, right, and center—support this plan. Even Wall Street has agreed. According to Moody's, by the end of this year, this law will spur our economy to create 7 million new jobs. And it does one more thing: It focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country—working families, the middle class, the people who built this country. But as I said last week, it's one thing to pass a historic piece of legislation like the American Rescue Plan, and it's quite another to implement it. And the devil is in the details. It requires fastidious oversight to make sure the relief arrives quickly, equitably, and efficiently with no waste or fraud in your bank account, in your mailbox, to the local business in your community, and to your child's school. Look, I've been here before. When President Obama and I came into office in 2009, he put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act, which helped us recover and rebuild during the Great Recession. I was authorized to put together a team, including an accountability board with Inspectors General from different agencies that were affected by the act to make sure we got the roughly $800 billion out—out and into the countryside—by the book and quickly, over 18 months. I talked to literally almost a hundred—over 150 mayors, all Governors except one, constantly going over the granular detail of the implementation of this legislation—that legislation. And the effort put us on a path from crisis to recovery to resurgence. Accordingly, to the oversight board that these—of Inspectors General—they said we got it done with less than two-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud. And that's not what the previous administration did though. When the Congress, last year, passed the CARES Act, the CARES Act—the Congress created a Committee of Inspectors General to make sure every penny of that money was spent as it was directed. But one of the first things the previous administration did was fire the head of the Inspector Generals' Committee. So when Congress passed what was intended to be a small business relief program, it instead became a free-for-all for well-connected companies. And mainstream businesses, from hardware stores to beauty salons, that needed the help most were left behind. Four hundred thousand are now gone. We will not let that happen this time. I learned from my experience implementing the Recovery Act just how important it is to have someone who can manage all the moving parts with efficiency, speed, and integrity and accountability. That's the sort of management we've seen in our fight against the virus with Jeff Zients, our COVID Response Coordinator. And today I'm pleased to announce and introduce another gifted manager to coordinate our implementation of the American Rescue Plan: Gene Sperling. Gene will be on the phone with mayors and Governors, red States, blue States. A source of constant communication, a source of guidance and support, and above all, a source of accountability for all of us to get the job. Gene has been here before. The only person in history to serve as Director of economic—of the National Economic Council twice. He led successful efforts to deliver relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans in the Obama-Biden administration and in the Clinton administration. I spoke with Gene earlier today, alongside my economic team; he's ready to get to work. In fact, he's already hit the ground running. And together we're going to make sure that the benefits the American Rescue Plan go out quickly and directly to the American people, where they belong. Let me close with this: Help is here and hope is here in real and tangible ways. We're just days away from 100 million shots in millions—in the arms of millions of Americans. That's the way. That's the way—on the way to get every single American access to the vaccine. One hundred million checks going into the pockets—and/or direct deposits—going into the pockets of Americans, on the way to a million more—millions of more Americans. That's real progress. But we have a lot more to do. We have to prove to the American people that their Government can deliver for them and do it without waste or fraud: that we can vaccinate the Nation; that we can get our kids safely back in school; that we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses open and stay open; and that we can give people of this Nation a fighting chance again with relief checks, lower childcare costs, lower health care costs, and so much more. That's our job. That's our responsibility. And in the process, we'll be growing the economy as well. We're going to have to stay on top of every dollar spent through the American Rescue Plan. And that's what we're going to do. We can do this. We will do this. God bless you all. Help us on the way. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much. Former President Donald J. Trump/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts  Q. Should President Donald Trump help promote the vaccine among skeptics, sir, especially those Republicans who say they're not willing to take it? The President. I'm hearing a lot of reports from serious reporters like you saying that. I discussed it with my team, and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say. So I urge—I urge all local docs and—and ministers and priests and every—to talk about why—why it's important to get it—to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is, in fact, vaccinated, to wear this mask. Thank you very much. Thank you. [At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]"
"Mar 17, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Virtual Meeting With Prime Minister Michéal Martin of Ireland,"The President. As I said, they—I'm going to turn this down just a little bit. [At this point, the President pulled down his mask.] As I said, this is a great outfit. This is a union shop. These are people who work like the devil, and they can make a living wage, a decent wage. But 300,000 Pennsylvanians lost jobs—300,000. And in Delaware County alone—this in 2020—19,000. And I'm not being solicitous when I say these are two of the finest Congressmen in the United States Congress in terms of getting things done. I really mean it. And you know, the American Rescue Plan is going to do more than just provide for the PPE. And one of the things that we've done early on—they passed the CARES Act early on. And what we did—what they did was they provided for an Inspector General, an outfit to look over where the money was going to make sure that it was spent properly. And the first thing the President did: he came along; he fired the Inspector General. And we found out that only 40 percent of the people who, in fact, were small businesses got in on the deal. And they got very big businesses getting the lion's share of that money. So when we wrote this Rescue Plan, they were part of the insisting that we have an Inspector General to make sure the money goes exactly where it's supposed to go. And so we're in a position where it's going to bring immediate relief—$1,400—to 85 percent of the American public. I said yesterday we're going to get 100 million shots in people's arms within the first 60 days of my administration and 100 million checks out—100 million people are going to be getting, not a joke, a check for $1,400, which would change their lives. And you know so many of the people who have worked—[inaudible]—and gotten themselves laid off or there wasn't work, and you find yourself, you know, it's hard paying the rent, hard paying the childcare, hard paying for much of anything. So I just think that—I hope that the program that we're having here—we're going to have a tax cut to help retired workers. We're in a situation where we're going to expand the Paycheck Protection Program for the folks who were initially shut out. Initially, at the very beginning of the Paycheck Protection Program, you'd go to a big bank, they'd say: ""Do you have an account with us? Have you borrowed money from us? Do you have a credit card from us?"" They didn't want to deal with people who were on the short side of things. But you've really made it work. And I think you should be aware: More help is on the way, for real. Do you have questions for me at all? Smith Flooring Inc. President Kristin Smith. Well, we don't have any questions, but we did want to say thank you. Thank you for your being who you are. Thank you for helping the small business—small minority business. It means a lot that you're here in Chester. It means a lot that you came to see our business because, you know, although Congresswoman Scanlon and Congresswoman Houlahan, sorry—I know Congresswoman Scanlon a little more. [Laughter] Sorry. But not many people come out and stop here in Chester. And so we're just grateful. We're grateful for the things that you're doing. The President. Every time I got stopped in Chester, I lost. [Laughter] I went to school in Claymont, just across the line, Archmere Academy. And we played up here, and you'd better come prepared to play against Chester. [Laughter] Mrs. Smith. That's true. The President. Yes, you always came prepared to play in Chester. So a lot of my buddies are from Chester, for real, the people I grew up with. And it's—you know, one of the things that we haven't—and we're trying like the devil to make sure to correct is: People who are hardest hit by—and the Congresswoman knows this better than I do—the hardest hit are people in the minority communities. Their—the rate at which they get COVID is significantly higher sometimes in the Latino community, Black community, four times greater, and the death rate is significantly higher. And in the last place—and that's why we're working so hard—they're working so hard to make sure to get the vaccines in places that are not ordinarily the focus. That's why we put these vaccines in community health centers. That's why we have them in drugstores now. That's why we have mobile units. But I'm not just saying this because we're here. They have been loud and strong voices getting this done. And it's not like it passed with a hundred votes. You know what I mean? It's—it was close. And I want to thank you both. And everybody in this county and the next county, in Delaware County, should thank you as well. So is there anything else we can be doing? Mrs. Smith. We just want—— The President. How many employees at your peak? Smith Flooring Inc. Vice President James Smith. At our peak, we're at about 20, 23 people. Our peak is summertime. We do a lot of school work, and so that's when we get our big boost. The President. Yes. Mr. Smith. Right now we're about 12: 12 people between people in the office, out in the field. The President. I think it's going to allow you to bring folks back and increase your business. Mr. Smith. And it's great that schools got funding, so now the schools are going to do some construction and—[inaudible]. The President. Yes. No, that's good. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. Well, you both do a heck of a job. Mrs. Smith. Thank you."
"Mar 17, 2021",Remarks at a Virtual Irish Community Event,"President Biden. I'm going to make a brief opening statement about a current thing going on in the United States here, and that is the shooting down in Atlanta where eight people were killed and—seven women, six of Asian American background. And I was just, on the telephone, briefed by the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI. And the investigation is ongoing, and the question of motivation is still to be determined. But whatever the motivation here, I know that Asian Americans are in very—very concerned because, as you know, I've been speaking about the brutality against Asian Americans for the last couple months, and I think it's a—it is very, very troublesome. And—but I'm making no connection at this moment for the motivation of what the—of the killer. I'm waiting for an answer from—as the investigation proceeds, from the FBI and from the Justice Department. So—and that's—so I'll have more to say when the investigation is completed. Now, I want to say Happy St. Patrick's Day to the Taoiseach. [Laughter] It's good to have you on television. But next year, in Washington. Next year, in Washington. For years, as you know, Taoiseach, we celebrated this St. Patrick's Day. I always put on a breakfast at my home, and—at the Vice President's Residence—with leading Irish Americans, your Ambassador, our Ambassador, as well as some of the prelates who were involved with this. And it was always a good time. Then, we'd go into this very office. You'd sit in the chair over here—the Taoiseach would sit there. And I'd sit where the—my National Security Adviser is sitting, and we'd have a long discussion with the President. And then we'd go up to the United States Capitol, where the Speaker of the House, starting with Tip O'Neill, would put on an event as well. And then I always snuck over to the Irish Embassy later. I hope we can do that next year. I hope we can do that next year. And in the meantime, I want to thank you for the shamrock bowl. I don't know whether you can see it here, but it's a great tradition, a custom that goes all the way back to Harry Truman, who—I have a bust of Harry Truman over in that corner. I noticed he didn't move to grab any of the shamrocks, but—— And tonight, Taoiseach, I wish you—we hope you'll be able to see it, at least remotely. We're going to light up the White House in green. And we—to celebrate the deep, deep affection that the—we Americans have, particularly Irish Americans have for Ireland and the people of Ireland. And that includes millions of Americans like my great-great-grandfather and my great-grandfather and my grandfather, all of whom were Irish Americans on both sides of the family. My grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, who was a great football player—American football—and a newspaper man back at the turn of the 19th—of the 20th century, used to always say when—later when he was much older and I'd walk out of his home, he'd say, ""Joey, remember: The best drop of blood in you is Irish."" [Laughter] I remembered it, I promise you. And—because if I didn't, my grandmother, Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan, would take me down. And we have a lot of great memories as well in our family because one of your predecessors—I went over. I've been to Ireland many times, but the first time I went to actually go back and look at my roots and meet my family was back when—the last year we were—I was Vice President of the United States. And we went both to Mayo, where the Blewitts are from, and Ballina, the city; and we went to County Louth, where the Finnegans are from. And it was a great, great opportunity for me to show my grandchildren and children and my brother and sister. I joked at the time, but I—after I left, I wondered why the hell we left in the first place. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. And so, I think, you know, there's a lot of folks here in Ireland—my friends from Ireland would always say the American Irish think they're more Irish than the Irish. But the truth of the matter is that we have a great affection for the country and a great affection for the tradition. And we have a—Ireland and the United States have a robust agenda that we've got to deal with on the substantive side of this—of these issues, Taoiseach, and—from combating COVID to strengthening global health security, to also discussing our economic cooperation and Ireland's leadership now in the U.N. Security Council, which we're working together. Our U.N. Ambassador is online with us here. And I just welcome the leadership and your partnership. And you know my view and the view of my predecessor, my—of the Obama-Biden administration on the Good Friday Agreements. We strongly support them; think it's critically important that they be maintained. And the political and economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our peoples—the people-to-people ties. And I think the idea that we talked about, about renewing our partnership and the All-Ireland Consortium—Cancer Consortium. The U.S., Ireland, and Northern Ireland—it's a partnership that's—that I think we can learn a lot from one another. It's one of the things that, as President, Taoiseach, I am going to focus heavily on with our National Institute of Health: on dealing with cancer. We've all been victims of it, in terms of our families. We all know what it's like. And we're going to make major investments in NIH and cancer research and development. And I'm looking forward to working together. As a matter of fact, my relatives in Mayo just dedicated a—my—Laurita, one of my cousins, headed up the hospice effort for cancer—not just cancer, but hospice in Ireland. And they just dedicated a new, significant facility to my son Beau Biden, who died of cancer. And so, everything between Ireland and the United States runs deep, Taoiseach: our joys, our sorrows, our passion, our drive, and our unrelenting optimism and hope. One of the few quotes that I've been given credit for of my career was, I said—but I mean it—maybe it's just my family—I said, ""We Irish are the only people who are nostalgic for the future."" [Laughter] And I think we are. It's a great opportunity for you and I to get to talk a little bit. So I'm looking forward to our conversation, and I'm looking forward to getting deeper into discussion about some of the things that are of great mutual interest to both of us. But as we used to say in the United States Senate, Taoiseach, ""I yield the floor to you."" [At this point, Prime Minister Martin spoke via videoconference from Dublin, Ireland.] Prime Minister Martin. Thank you very much indeed, Mr. President. I'm quite—first of all, again, on behalf of the Irish people, to you I express my condolences to the people of America and, indeed, to the people of Atlanta and the families of those who were killed and injured in the horrible and very shocking shootings yesterday. And our solidarity is with you, particularly with the Asian American community. We stand together against such mindless acts of violence. But I know, Mr. President, that St. Patrick's Day is very special to you as a proud son of Ireland. Equally, I have to tell you, the people of Ireland are so proud of your election as President of the United States of America. And I can think of no better day for me to have the great pleasure to extend to you their warmest greetings. President Biden. Thank you. Prime Minister Martin. Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig dhuit. Happy St. Patrick's Day. Now, as you said, it seems strange to have to celebrate apart. As you know well, Irish people love to come together to celebrate our heritage and culture with song, with dance, with parades, with poetry, and with pride. And this year, because of the pandemic, it just simply is impossible. And here in Ireland, people are make—are marking the occasion in their homes, but they will be thinking especially of their loved ones around the world and sending them best thoughts and wishes. And they will do so in the hope that next year will be better, as I do believe it will. President Biden. It will. Prime Minister Martin. With each person vaccinated, we move closer to the day when people can meet each other, hug each other, and celebrate again. And I greatly look forward to you being able to visit Ireland as you have done so many times and, as you have said, so memorably before. I also hope it will not be long before I can visit the United States again. For now, the bowl of shamrock in front of you is a symbol of the undying friendship between our two countries—a symbol of the good times we have shared and the challenges we've endured, always at each other's side. The green shoots point to the brighter future that I know lies ahead. And building that brighter future will, of course, be part of what we discuss today. The policies of our two governments are very closely aligned on the big challenges the world faces. And I look forward to exploring how we can defeat the COVID-19 virus, working together urgently to increase the supply of vaccine for our own people and for people around the world. We should share notes on our plans for recovery, getting back the ground lost to the pandemic. Both the United States and Europe have put funds of unprecedented scale in place to support this vital work and to build a sustainable and inclusive future supporting the digital and green agendas, promoting open and fair rules-based trade, delivering greater equality and opportunity. Mr. President, the world has rightly taken great heart from the steps you have already taken to bring the U.S. back to center stage on global health, on climate, and on human rights. We want to work with you to promote our shared values and interests in the world, including at the United Nations Security Council, on which we are, as you said, currently serving. We want to work with you on time and action, which becomes ever more urgent as we approach COP26 later this year. Today I especially want to thank you for your unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement. It has meant a lot, and it has mattered, including as we negotiated Brexit. With a new trading relationship now in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom and a protocol that protects peace and avoids a hard border on this island, I want to move forward with a positive relationship with the United Kingdom. And that means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. And that, in turn, then can help maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared island, goals that I know you support. There are so many areas where the Irish and American people are already working together, and we would celebrate some of them here today: a consortium through which our practitioners and researchers would improve their efforts to defeat cancer, that most pernicious disease that I know is very close to your heart in terms of dealing with that; a new initiative to share our poetry and bring it to newer and younger audiences that we will announce today. Mr. President, like you, I am fundamentally an optimist. We have all endured the most difficult year. But alongside the suffering and the loss, we have seen immense compassion, care, and courage, especially from our health workers, our educators, and our volunteers. We have seen the world's best scientists come together to deliver treatments, vaccines, and hope at extraordinary pace. And I say that the same spirit of cooperation now will speed and guide our recovery in the year ahead. And thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to our discussion. President Biden. I look forward to it as well. We're going to let the press walk out."
"Mar 18, 2021",Remarks on the 100 Million Shot Goal,"I'm delighted to see you all. And I can see some familiar faces up there, and thank you for all you've done. Look, you know, I—we all—I spent a lot of time with the Taoiseach today, and he was pointing out to me that my win for the Presidency was more popular in Ireland than it was in United States. [Laughter] And that's not too far off. One of the things that happened is that, when I was Vice President, I'd spent a lot—I've been to Ireland many times as chairman of the European Affairs subcommittee. But I'm going back and forth, looking at you guys; I should look straight, I know. The—but one of the things that happened was I would host—some of you know because you attended them—I'd always host a breakfast for the Taoiseach when I was chairman in the United States Senate. But when I became Vice President—— [At this point, the camera shifted.] I'd leave that alone, guys. Okay? Tell them not to move that, all right? I'm having troubles here. Okay? But here's the thing: One of the things that I did, I would host a breakfast for the Taoiseach. And then, I would take him in to meet the President, and then we'd go up to a thing that Tip O'Neill started when he was the Speaker, and host the—on St. Patrick's Day—host the Taoiseach and his delegation. And then, I'd always find some excuse to get to the Irish Embassy. But toward the end of our term as Vice President, the Taoiseach came in and said, ""Barack, let the boy go back to Ireland."" And I've been to Ireland many times, but he said: ""Let him go back and bring his family and spend some time. He's not ever looked up his relatives."" So they went and did a genealogy. The Irish Times had done—which I had already known—but had done the genealogy for Barack, as well, to identify his great-great-great-grandfather. And they did one for me as well. And it's interesting that my great-great-great-grandfather Finnegan left for Ireland from County Louth—and he was a shoemaker—within a week of the time that Barack's grandfather left, and he was a shoemaker. And so when I got to Ireland, they pointed out to me—they had done the genealogy—that the likelihood that, as small as the population was and as close as they lived together, the idea of boarding two ships out Newry within a week of one another—actually 6 days—and then not knowing one another was highly unlikely. And as they say in parts of Claymont, Delaware, ""Who woulda thunk it"" that two guys getting on what were thought to be coffin ships in 1847, making their way to United States, would produce a President and Vice President of the United States of America? And that's how the trip started. But one of the things that I learned growing up was that, you know, that old Irish expression, ""May the hinges of our friendship never grow rusty."" Now, the truth of the matter is, of all the joys and honor in my 8 years as Vice President, it was hosting those St. Patrick's Day breakfasts, and the—with the Taoiseach in his visits to Washington. And while our—while, you know, the celebration has been virtual this year, we're able to continue that tradition with the Shamrock ceremony that you probably—I'd explained to you started back with Harry Truman. The Taoiseach would always send a crystal bowl with—full of shamrocks in it. And it was—the Taoiseach would always send his best from, quote, ""the home sod."" But like many of you, I grew up hearing all these stories about Ireland from my ancestors. And I had a maiden aunt named Aunt Gertie—Gertrude Blewitt. And she was the older sister of my grandmother, Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan, who married my grandpop, Ambrose Finnegan. And her father was the first Irish Catholic elected to the State Senate in the State of Pennsylvania, in 1907, I believe. And he served there for some time. And the unusual thing was: He was—back in those days, if you lived in Scranton or the coal mining area, and you were Catholic, you didn't get much of an opportunity to go to college. It was not something that was—there wasn't a whole lot of love and affection between the British who owned the mines and the Irish. And—but my grandfather graduated from—my grandfather, Blewitt—Edward Francis Blewitt—graduated from college and—as a mining engineer. And I—they got—I was—I spoke at Lehigh University, and they showed me a picture of him in his letter sweater of '69—1869. And so, for the longest time, I'd hear these stories about my grandfather and what he had done and what he hadn't done. And one of the things that I found out was that he—supposedly, I had this—back to my maiden aunt now: She lived with my grandmother and Grandfather Finnegan, and they had five children: four boys and my mom. And she lived in the house with them on North Washington Avenue—which, by the way, they've renamed, after I won to every precinct in Scranton—they renamed ""Joe Biden Way"" in Scranton—[laughter]—which is kind of interesting. Anyway, what happened was that she did two things better than anybody else. When my dad lost his job, we went to live with my grandpop for a year while he came to Wilmington, Delaware, to get a job and get started again. He came home every weekend and—but I'd always—Aunt Gertie's room was on the third floor, which—half was turned into a nice bedroom. And I'd always go up in Aunt Gertie's room because she had two things better than anybody else. One is that she was the best backscratcher in the world. And, two, no offense to the Greeks, but she made the best rice pudding in the world. And you go up, and you'd lie with Aunt Gertie when I was 7, 8 years old, and she'd tell these stories about how the British burned down the—[inaudible]—and what they did to the Irish and all the persecution that took place. And she—as if she'd lived through it all. She had never been to Ireland. And I remember I—when my—I tell the story about the night she said to me: ""It's not your fault. Your father is a good man anyway."" And I never thought my father wasn't a good man. And she went on to tell me: ""It's not your father's fault that he has English blood. It's not his fault."" And so I tell that story a lot. And my sister Val, who's my—both my keeper and smarter than me—my sister said: ""Joey, stop telling that story. I don't remember that. I don't think it's true. I think your memory is wrong, and the press is going to jump all over you for saying that one of these days."" And so I stopped saying it because I thought: ""Well, maybe she's right. Maybe my memory is not correct."" And so my mom, when my dad passed away, moved in with me in Wilmington, Delaware, in our home. And when she died, I never had the courage to go through all her boxes of material that I had moved up to the third floor. And when I decided I was going to redo the third floor for my granddaughters, I figured, ""I'd better go through""—this is a year later—""go through the boxes and find out what's in the boxes,"" even though it was very emotionally difficult to do. And the first box I opened had, on top of it, 112 or -13 pages—typewritten pages—that look like parchment. Literally, if you bent them, they would snap; they'd break. And they were poems my great-grandfather Blewitt—Senator Blewitt had written. And he was a poet. And I—he—first poem on top of everything else was a poem entitled—and I have this all in my office. I should've brought it and showed you. I have these all bound. And it says—the title of the poem was ""My Mother's Land, Aroon""—A-R-O-O-N. And it started off the following paragraph: ""Oh, how I hate to learn that—how I learned to hate the British at my mother's knee. They bled poor Ireland dry until . . ."" Then, she goes on and on and on. Immediately called my sister to tell her that was the case—what was—that I was—my memory was correct. But it's amazing the stories you hear when you're growing up if you're Irish, you have Irish grandparents or parents that have some knowledge of the past. My grandfather, Finnegan, was an all-American at Santa Clara, graduated in 1807. He was a newspaper guy. And he was the—Irishman of rectitude. He wouldn't wear funny hats or do crazy things on St. Patrick's Day, but he always talked about Irish history. And he'd talk about how his grandfather would talk about—Owen Finnegan, when he came—about how—what Ireland was like. So the long story—to make a long story short, I was talking about this with the Taoiseach. And when I went back to Ireland for a 7-day period after—I told you, when Barack said—you know, when the Taoiseach said, ""Let the boy go home,"" I got an opportunity to literally talk to well over 10,000 people in Ireland. Ten thousand people showed up to see me in Mayo, where my great grandfather started the ""Sons of Mayo,"" which still exists in Scranton. And my grandfather, Finnegan, used to talk about County Louth and the Cooley Peninsula and all these things. And what I found out was much of what they said turned out to be true about the pain and the suffering that people had gone through and about just how strong the connection to the land and, in most cases, from my case, on St. Patrick's Day, to the faith it was. And so I found that, you know, one of the things that I—the only original quote I'm given credit for these days is my—over the years—is my characterization of the Irish: We're the only people in the world who are nostalgic for the future. The only people in the world who are nostalgic for the future. And it's a fascinating thing. And what I admire so much about what are our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great-grandparents did is their courage: their courage and their refusal to give up their optimism. You know, I used to always quote Irish poets on the floor of the Senate, and people thought I did it because I was Irish. I didn't do it because—I said it because they're the best poets in the world. That's why I did it. But all kidding aside, one of the poems that I would make the case of—I'm a great fan of Seamus Heaney, who passed away not long ago. I got to talk to him a little bit. He wrote a poem called ""A Cure at Troy."" And the poem—the stanza in the poem that I think is appropriate for today is, he said: History [teaches us not to] hope On [this] side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime The longed for tidal wave Of justice [rises] up And hope and history rhyme. I think that's who we are right now as a country. I think we've been through hell. The public has been through hell. People have lost—we've lost over 500,000 Americans—500,000 dead to COVID. Actually, it's about 531,000 to COVID. People have got to—gotten a chance to see what we've been on the other side of, as an Irish grace, and that is, they've gotten to see the systemic racism that still exists in the country. They've gotten to see how difficult it is for so many people to—and how, in fact, they've observed for the first time—all those people who allowed us to stay healthy and at home, while they were at this—while they were stacking the shelves at the supermarket, driving the ambulance, being the first responders. The people who, in fact, allowed us to stay safe, allowed us to be where we are. And I just think that there's a new sense of the ability of us to just come out—we're the only nation in the world, I think—and it's part of the Irish of it, not unique to us—but that have always come out of a terrible situation in this country better than when we went into it. Better than we went into it. We have a chance to reach out, kind of like our—you know, our ancestors did, to reach out and help each other, to reach out and help people who are in trouble. And that's what I've been trying to do since we got elected. And one of the things that is really a consequence to me is—you know, I talked about this with the Taoiseach: We talked about how we can write a new chapter: a new chapter in the enduring friendship between our nations. And about—we started with the renewal of a partnership—the U.S. and Ireland and Northern Ireland—as enhanced—we have an enhanced cancer research and cancer care facility now. We launched a new partnership between the Poetry Foundation of Chicago and the Poetry Ireland to promote appreciation for poetry in the United States and Ireland. You might have noticed that I'm a fan of those poets. And they also dropped by Vice President Harris, who was meeting with the Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, and Deputy Minister O'Neill. That represents Sinn Féin and the Unionists. And they're sitting in the same room at the same table I'm at here. And I conveyed my continued support for the Good Friday Agreements and political and economic stability in Northern Ireland, which is still shaky. The National Security Council Senior Director of Europe, Amanda Sloat will join us in bit. We're going to provide more update on those meetings. But the point is that I've often marveled at—that on one island, not much larger than the State of South Carolina, has given so much to America and so much to the world. I think the most precious gift that the Irish immigrant brought to America was the belief that this is a place of possibilities. I always tell foreign leaders when they ask me, ""Can I define America?""—like President Xi asked me on the Tibetan Plateau—I said, ""Yes, in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. If not for a belief in possibilities could a descendant of the Blewitts of Mayo County, the Finnegans of Louth sit here as President of the United States of America speaking to you in the White House, designed by an Irishman. An Irishman. This is a—when you come to visit me, James Hoban designed the White House—an Irishman. The symbol of the nation of where the Irish blood led—bled 15 Ireland—Éire—Ireland-born generals were spilled defending this Nation in the War of Independence. In years since, Irish Americans have fought wars; built our roads, our canals; started up businesses; written our songs; starred in our movies. Look, yes—you know, we know there's hard history of discrimination. We know hunger and hardship. We also know what's possible when we support each other. We've come together for progress. The story of the Irish and the Irish Americans is the story of people who have weathered hard times but always come through, spirit intact. We faced hardships in these hard times like our ancestors faced in theirs: the pandemic, hunger, an economy that's not working for so many people. We dream of a better, fairer, more prosperous America. We recognize that what Yeats wrote, ""In dreams began responsibility."" ""In dreams began responsibility."" Now, I want you to think of all your friendships, your support, and all—taking responsibility to build back the America we seek and we know we could have. You know, I'll leave you with one additional blessing. My grandfather used to have—his Irish blessing was, ""May those who love us, love us; and those who don't, may God turn their ankles so we know they're coming by their limp."" That's not the one, though, I'd use. But the one is, ""May your home always be too small to hold your friends."" I hope that in the future we'll be able to get together and put that blessing to the test. I wish you all the best and a Happy St. Patrick's Day. And I'm going to turn it back to Jen. But remember, there's not a damn thing—not a damn thing this country can't do when we do it together. And that's the Irish of it. It really is. We can do anything. We've been through a lot as a people. We can do anything we set our minds to. Thank you all so much. I hope next year we're doing it here at the White House because I'm looking forward to seeing you. Thank you so much."
"Mar 19, 2021","Remarks During a Briefing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia","The President. Well, folks, good to see you all. When I announced in early December that I had goal that I set of administering 100 million shots for the virus in the first 100 days of our office—100 million shots in 100 days—it was considered ambitious. Some even suggested it was somewhat audacious. Experts said that it was a—the plan was, quote, ""definitely aggressive,"" and distribution would have to be ""seamless"" for us to be successful. One headline simply put it, quote, ""It won't be easy."" End of quote. Well, it wasn't. When I took office—when we took office, there was a lot that had to be done. We needed more vaccines, more vaccinators, more places for people to get vaccinated. And we needed a whole-of-Government approach. So, I directed Jeff Zients, the coordinator of our COVID-19 response, to put us on a war footing—and I meant that in a literal sense—to get us on track to truly beat this virus. And I'm proud to announce that tomorrow, 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans. That's weeks ahead of schedule, and even with the setbacks we faced during the winter storms. And it's another big step on the path to checking the—putting checks in pockets and shots in people's arms. When we crossed the 50 million doses just 3 weeks ago, I told you that every time we hit the 50 million mark, I'd update you on our progress. So here is where we are today: Eight weeks ago, only 8 percent of seniors, those most vulnerable to COVID-19, had received a vaccination. Today, 65 percent of people aged 65 or older have received at least one shot, and 36 percent are fully vaccinated. And that's key, because this is a population that represents 80 percent of the well over 500,000 COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in America. We have nearly doubled the amount of vaccine doses that we distribute to States, tribes, and territories each week. We have gone from 1 million shots a day—that I promised in December, before we were even sworn in—to an average of 2½ million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world significantly. And here's how we accomplished this: Using the power given to a President under the Defense Production Act, we expedited critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. We worked with vaccine manufacturers to speed up the delivery of millions more doses and brokered a historic manufacturing partnership between competing companies who put patriotism and public health first. These steps put us on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by the end of May—months—months earlier than anyone expected. And we stood up or supplied more than 600 community vaccination sites that are administering hundreds of thousands of shots per day. We launched the Federal Pharmacy Program, which has allowed millions of Americans to get a shot at one of 1,000—or, excuse me, one of 14,000 local pharmacies in this country, the same way they get their flu shot. And for folks who aren't near a pharmacy or mass vaccination center, we've supplied more than 500 mobile clinics, like pop-up sites or vans, meeting people where they are—meeting people where they are. We've developed nearly—we've deployed nearly 6,000 Federal personnel, including FEMA, Active Duty military, and Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccinations and serve as vaccinators—putting the needle in people's arms. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit—the hardest hit—and suffered the most, especially Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. This is really important, because we believe that speed and efficiency must be matched with fairness and equity. Now, when [Vice]* President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona not long ago, one of the nurses on that tour, injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope. ""A dose of hope."" That's how she phrased it. Behind these 100 million shots are millions of lives changed when people receive that dose of hope. Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again. Frontline workers who can show up at their jobs without the same fear they used to have. Teachers—with the confidence to head back into the classroom. These milestones are significant accomplishments, but we have much more to do. Much more to do. And the American Rescue Plan will help us do it. In addition to the cash payments it provides to you and your families, it also provides the funds to add vaccinators, to supply more community vaccination—support more community vaccination centers, and increase testing. It will help us accelerate nationwide efforts to reopen our schools safely. And as I told the Nation last week, I've directed all States, tribes, and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May the 1st. I'm glad to see that several States are already taking that step to make more and more Americans eligible, even before May 1. Tomorrow we will hit 100 million doses our administration has administered. But I've always said that's just the floor. We will not stop until we beat this pandemic. Next week, I will announce our next goal to put shots in arms. This is a time for optimism, but it's not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans—I need all of you to do your part: wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it's your turn. Now is not the time to let down our guard. In the last week, we've seen increases in the number of cases in several States. Scientists have made clear that things may get worse as new variants of this virus spread. Getting vaccinated is the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants. While millions of people are vaccinated, we need millions more to be vaccinated. And, again, I need you to get vaccinated when it come—when it's your turn, when you're able to do that. I need your help. I need you to help, not just the country, but your family, your friends, your neighbors. Get them vaccinated as well. If we keep our guard up, stick together, and stick with the science, we can look forward to a Fourth of July that feels a bit more normal, with small groups able to gather for cookouts in backyards, and when we'll be—where we begin to declare our independence on Independence Day from the virus. Look, together—together we're going to come through this stronger, with renewed faith in each other, in our Government that fulfills its most important function: protecting the American people. Let me be clear again: wearing this mask in the meantime; making sure you wash your hands; making sure you socially distance and listen to the CDC. We've got to reach the point where we have herd immunity—meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated—before we can stop wearing these. So, please, please, don't let what's happening—you see happening in Europe and you see on television. Keep the faith, keep wearing the mask, keep washing your hands, and keep socially distanced. We're going to beat this. We're way ahead of schedule, but we've got a long way to go. So I just wanted to bring you up to date. And I thank you very much. And may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much."
"Mar 19, 2021","Remarks at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia","The President. You know, one of the things that caught my attention—I think we talked about this very early on, within the first 6 weeks of the virus becoming where it—everybody, and people starting to get sick, and some of them die. And—was I got a call from a mayor, a really great guy, a real hard-working fellow in Detroit, saying to me, ""Mr. President, you don't understand."" This was even before—I wasn't President then, actually. He called me, ""Mr. Vice President."" He said: ""You know, it's—I don't think people understand. You know, my community is now about 80 percent African American. And we're dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the White community here or any other community."" And I brought that up, initially, before I put together that group that you're leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it. And I remember they—we had trouble getting your predecessors just to track it. But what you're doing really makes a difference. It makes a gigantic difference. As the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody, it really, really makes a difference. So thank you. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Chief Health Equity Officer Leandris Liburd. Thank you. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you. Chief Health Equity Officer Liburd. Dr. Walensky. Thank you so much. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle P. Walensky. Any other questions for us? The President. No, but why are you all standing? [Laughter] That's the first one. You don't have to stand for us. Why don't you sit down? For real. Get comfortable. Vice President Harris. No chair. The President. No, they have chairs. Participant. We do it all the time, sir. The President. They have chairs. [Laughter] But you know, that's the first question. And the second question is, why did only one person clap? I don't know. [Laughter] They might take that to say—you know what I mean? I'm teasing. I'm teasing. The reason I do this, as the doc knows—[laughter]—you all are too serious here—we owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude, and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what's going to come again and again and again and again. We can build all the walls we want. We can have the most powerful armies in the world, we can—but we cannot stop—we cannot stop these viruses, other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them. And the one thing that I—the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to—anyway—to have Doc here is that science is back. No, all kidding aside. Think about it: For the longest time, not just as it relates to CDC, but science was viewed as sort of an appendage to anything else we were talking about. But it's back. Participant. That's right. The President. And I just want you to have some confidence that it's not only—are the Vice President and I and the whole team, and the whole COVID team writ large committed, but the American people have moved. The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now. Now, it isn't showing itself in the way Senators and Congressmen vote, but the public—the public. We were talking about it on a helicopter—on the airplane. Vice President Harris. Yes, yes. The President. The public in a bipartisan way. When I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID—and the economic relief side of it as well—we were told that it could never pass; we'd never get any help. Well, we didn't get any help in the Senate or the House, but you have 55 percent of the Republicans in America supporting it. You have 90-some percent of the Democrats, 80-some—the point is, the public is thankful to you, because it's about science. That's what they understand. They understand. And we're not going back to the old days. Even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think things have—you've changed things. You've changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country. And when we have a crisis, you're prepared to meet it, because you speak truth and science to power, and that is the power. So, to all of the folks listening—I guess you said there's hundreds or if not thousands of people listening. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Incident Manager Henry Walke. Thousands. Yes. The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you've done. I don't just mean learning about how to deal with a virus. Learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science, and just wherever it takes you, and just be honest about it. And that's what you've all done. So we owe you a debt of gratitude in all the lives you've saved. I carry in my pocket—and the doc knows—on the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before. I mean for cumulative. We're at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night. It's got to stop. But you're slowing it. It's stopping. And it really, really matters. You know, that's more people than have died in all of World War—Americans—all of World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined—combined—in a year. In a year. And you are the Army. You're the Navy. You're the Marines. You're the Coast Guard. I really mean it. This is a war. And you are the frontline troops. It sounds silly to say it that way. It sounds sort of grand. But think about it. And finally, we got the vaccines. We got the companies together. And then, they didn't have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there's a thing called the Defense Production Act. As President, I'm allowed to enforce it. So I had people saying, ""Stop making that, and start making these."" We finally put together—did you ever think you'd see the day—because you've all been involved with medicine—see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country? [Laughter] One invents—one comes up with the drug, and the other says, ""Well, we'll manufacture it for you""? So what you're doing really, really, really matters, not only—and I'll end with this—not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country. Changing the mindset of the country. And it's affected everything, not just affected people's health. It's affected their attitude: the attitude about what we can do as a country. Everybody thought that I was—I didn't quite understand when I announced that we were going to—we had over 100 million shots in less than—you remember when I said we're going to—my goal was to have 100 million shots in people's arms in the first 100 days as President? And everybody said, ""Oh, that sounds—yes, right."" Now it's, ""He should have been more—have been, you know""—[laughter]. ""Why didn't they say more?"" You know what I mean? But here's the point: The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things. And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time: Because this is the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together. And that's what you're showing everybody. So I came to say thank you. I really mean it. I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but—[laughter]—but I came here to say thank you, because you're not only—you're changing the psyche of the country. You're saving lives. You're saving lives. But you're changing the psyche of the country. And this is, as I said—it's not being—I don't think we're being chauvinistic about our country, but this is—think about it: We're the only country in the world that has, every time we've gone into a crisis, have come out stronger immediately after the crisis than when we went in before the crisis. Think about it. It's about who we are. Closing comment: I was with Xi Jinping in China. I spent more time with him, I'm told, than any world leader because when he was Vice President, I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President. And I spent—traveled 17,000 miles with him in China, in the United States, and Asia generally, and met with him, I guess, they tell me, 24, 25 hours alone, just me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter. And by the way, I handed in all my notes. [Laughter] Minor point. But all kidding aside, he asked me—we were on the Tibetan Plateau. He asked me and said to me, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said: ""Yes, in one word. And I mean it—in one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. That's what you guys believe in: possibilities, based on science and hard data. And so I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart—your heart, your determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And I shouldn't have done that because I wanted to yield to my Vice President, who's smarter than I am. [Laughter] Vice President Harris. Well, there's not much to add to that, Mr. President. [Laughter] The President. Oh, just sorry. Vice President Harris. No, I—but I will say that I do believe that this administration, with the leadership of our President, is without any question about science. And everyone here knows, before the President was President, he was dedicated to science—the Moonshot, the—and so—and my mother was a scientist. I grew up—the first job I had, little-known fact, was cleaning pipettes at her lab. I was awful. She fired me. [Laughter] And then, there was this moment of global crisis. And the President takes calls with leaders around the world. We talk with people around the world. And they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control. They put their—the name of their country, and they call it ""CDC."" Participant. That's right. Vice President Harris. You all are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that which will uplift and improve human condition and life. And you guys do this work around the clock. And so we are here to say thank you, because it's not easy. You're making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you're making those decisions based on science, based on hard work, and based on a commitment to the public health. And therein lies part of the nobility of your work. You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet, on behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their well-being. So we are here to thank you. Thank you. The President. Thank you."
"Mar 21, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters Upon Returning From Camp David, Maryland","Thank you, and good afternoon. Sorry we're a little late, but we had an opportunity to meet with leaders of the AAPI community downstairs, and it was heart wrenching to listen to them. As many of you know, we originally planned to hold a car rally to thank our supporters. But given the recent days—events of recent days, we didn't feel it was appropriate, so we canceled that rally. But we want our supporters to know we'll come back and hold that rally another trip. But today we want to speak about something else. I said from the beginning of my campaign for President that we needed to come together; that we needed to unite as one people, one Nation, one America. I said in my kickoff speech in Philadelphia. I said that very same thing when I spoke at Gettysburg. I said that in my inaugural address. And I believe it with every fiber of my being. There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans. One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our Nation. The Vice President and I, as I said, met a little bit earlier, just before this, with leaders from the Asian American community here in Georgia. We talked about Tuesday's mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis, of gun violence in this country. Eight people killed, seven women. Six were of Asian descent. All fellow Americans. Each one of them we mourn. Their families are left with broken hearts and unanswered questions. And the investigation is ongoing. And the Vice President and I are being regularly updated by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, working closely with Governor Kemp and Mayor Bottoms and local officials. But whatever the motivation, we know this: Too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake. They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated, and harassed. They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed. Documented incidents against—of hate against Asian Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year, let alone the ones that happened and never get reported. It's been a year of living in fear for their lives just to walk down the street. Grandparents leave—to leave—afraid to leave their homes. Small-business owners targeted and gunned down. Attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our Nation: the elderly, low-wage workers, and women. In fact, Asian American women suffer twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men. We're learning again what we've always known: Words have consequences. It's the coronavirus. Full stop. The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders—and that we're hearing all across the country—is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. And it's often met with silence. That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change, because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act. My first week in office, I signed an Executive order directing Federal agencies to combat this resurgence of xenophobia. The Department of Justice is strengthening its partnership with the AAPI community to prevent these crimes, in addition to its other work to take on violent extremists and domestic terrorism. I'm calling on Congress to pass and get my—to get to my desk the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And the House just passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, a law I authored more than 25 years ago and is one of my proudest legislative achievements. I call on the Senate to swiftly pass it and get it to my desk. But for all the good that laws can do, we have to change our hearts. Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. And it's on all of us—all of us, together—to make it stop. Something else should bring us together, and that is a belief in science. Science isn't something that should divide us. There's nothing political about it. There's nothing partisan about it. One of America's best examples of commitment to science is headquartered right here in Atlanta: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC represent the best of this Nation: brilliant minds, deep faith in science, and a strong commitment to public service. We came here to thank them for all the work they do and especially the work they've done over the course of this pandemic. We owe them and their families our gratitude. And we wanted to convey to them the absolute commitment to give them everything they need to do their work and get it done, free of politics and guided by science. And because of them, we're making real progress. We just met my goal of administering 100 million shots before my first 100 days in office. We did it in about 60 days. We're not stopping now. The American Rescue funds more vaccines, more vaccination centers, and more increases in testing. It's going to help us accelerate our nationwide effort to reopen schools safely. Last week, I directed all States, Tribes, and Territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. But while this is a time of optimism, it's not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans to keep doing your part: wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it's your turn. None of this is political. It's all science-based. But now is not the time to let down our guard down. That's science-based as well. In the last week, we've seen increases in the number of cases in several States. Things may get worse as new variants of the virus spread. That's why we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, because it's the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants. We will do—we have to beat this virus. We have to, and we will. But we'll do it by setting aside politics and embracing science. On another subject, the right to vote, that should bring us together as well, but it now divides us. This is a democracy, and the right to vote is fundamental. The fact that there was a record turnout in America in the last election, in the midst of a pandemic, should be something we celebrated, not attacked. The fact that you held a free and fair election in Georgia that stood up to recount after recount, court case after court case, is something you should be proud of. The fact that your poll workers, your election workers, your volunteers, your local officials, your State officials, your courts stood up to the immense pressure with character and honesty and integrity helped save our democracy. And this country will long be grateful for it. But as this State, home to Martin Luther King and John Lewis, knows better than most: The battle for the right to vote is never, ever over. And it's not over here, in this State of Georgia. So we're in the fight again. It's a fight we need to win. Because if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved it did. If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia just proved it 11,779 times. And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can. Because when you elected two new United States Senators, you made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan. Landmark legislation will not only meet the emergency we're in, but transform this Nation—starting with this: For those folks who either already have or will soon have $1,400 in their pockets, you can thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff. But for their votes, it would not have happened. What does that mean? It means 85 percent of the households in America will get that money. Here in Georgia, it means 88 percent of all adults and 88 percent of the children in this State will get that $1,400 as well. Just add it up. A typical family—two parents, two kids—earning $100,000 a year, each will get $1,400. That's $5,600 for that family that's in distress trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, pay their rent, keep food on the table. And that's not all. There's something called a ""child tax credit."" What that basically means is, you get a tax credit for every child you have. The American Rescue Plan expands that credit. It means that families of over 2 million children in Georgia will be eligible for an increase in that child tax credit of [up to]* $1,600 per year—per child. And it's going to be delivered on a regular basis. So, starting this summer, families with young kids will get $300 a month per child. This is going to lift 177,000 [171,000]* children in Georgia out of poverty. The American Rescue Plan expands coverage and reduces costs under the Affordable Care Act. So for a family of four earning $90,000 per year, with insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they'll see about $200 a month off their monthly premiums. And for Georgia's schools, the American Rescue Plan provides around $4 billion for Georgia's schoolchildren, from grades K through 12, to help them reopen safely. And here's one of the biggest things for Georgia: Because of the American Rescue Plan, Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion to expand Medicaid. What does that mean? It means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across this State with Medicaid that don't have it now. For your State and local governments, this is what it does: State Government will get around $5 billion to make up for lost revenue. Local governments will get around $3.5 billion. That's going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other first responders on the job. And here's one final thing the American Rescue Plan does: For the first time in a long time, it puts the working families, the middle class—people who built this country—first, not last. Sixty-six percent of the tax breaks in this plan go to folks making $90,000 or less a year. And how much for the top 1 percent—where 83 percent of all of the tax cut—it was the last President's tax cut? Zero. The top 1 percent get zero. But the American Rescue Plan isn't only about putting money in the pockets—people's pockets. It also will create and spur economic growth in America. That's why major economists—left, right, and center—support this plan. Even Wall Street agrees. According to Moody's, this law will help America create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year. And we'll do it by rebuilding the backbone of this Nation: the working people, the middle class—the people who built this country. It's about giving those people a fair shot for a change. It's about providing and proving to the American people that their Government works and can deliver for them, which brings me to my last point. The American Rescue Plan is a plan that brings America together and benefits all America. That's why so many polls show that over 70 percent of the country support it, including Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Maybe Republicans in Washington didn't vote for it, but the American Rescue Plan sure has brought the country together. And, for me, that measure of unity, that's what matters. Let me end with this: There's so much we can do if we do it together; if we remember who we are; if we stand together against hate; once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for the right of all Americans to vote and have access to voting; if we remember we're here to help all the people of this country, not just those few at the top; if we remember to do justice, love mercy, to walk humbly as fellow human beings and as fellow Americans; if we remember we're the United States of America and that, together, there is nothing—not a single thing—we cannot do if we do it together. My heart goes out to all—all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday. I know they feel that—like there's a black hole in their chest they're being sucked into and things will never get better. But our prayers are with you. And I assure you the one you've lost will always be with you. Always be with you. And the day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now. It will take a while, but I promise you it will come. And when it does, that's the day you know you're going to make it. May God bless all those families. May God protect our troops. Thank you very much."
"Mar 23, 2021","Remarks on the Shooting in Boulder, Colorado, and an Exchange With Reporters","Mexico-U.S. Border  Q. Are you thinking of going to the border? The President. Say what?  Q. Are you thinking of going to the border? The President. At some point, I will. Yes. Detention of Migrants at the Mexico-U.S. Border  Q. Do you want to see firsthand what's going on in those facilities? The President. I know what's going on in those facilities. Q. And do you—— Migration During the COVID-19 Pandemic  Q. Mr. President, why do you think the message to the migrants, telling them to stay home and don't come now—why do you think that hasn't resonated yet? What more can be done, sir? The President. A lot more. We're in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was they can stay in place and make their case from their home country. Thank you. Q. And when will you allow the media into those facilities?"
"Mar 23, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters During a Tour of the Radiation Oncology Department of the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute in Columbus, Ohio","The President. There's still a great deal we don't know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting. I've been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI. I've spoken with the Governor, and I'll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft. We're working very closely with the State and local law enforcement officials, and they're going to keep me updated as they learn more. You're going to ask me to speculate—understandably, you'd ask me to speculate—on what happened, why it happened, and I'm not going to do that now because we don't have all the information, not until I have all the facts. But I do know this: As President, I can use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe. As I said: At this moment, a great deal remains unknown. But three things are certain. First, 10 lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the State of Colorado. And Jill and I are devastated. And the feeling—I just can't imagine how the families are feeling—the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what's happened. Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying halfstaff for the tragedy, another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma. And the State that—I even hate to say it because we're saying it so often: My heart goes out. Our hearts go out for the survivors. The—who had to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, unsure if they would ever see their families again, their friends again. The consequences of all this are deeper than I suspect we know. By that, I mean the mental consequences, a feeling of—anyway, it just—we've been through too many of these. The second point I want to make is: My deepest thanks to the heroic police and other first responders who acted so quickly to address the situation and keep the members of their community safe. And, to state the obviously—the obvious, I commend the exceptional bravery of Officer Eric Talley. And I send my deepest condolences to his family—his close, close family of seven children. You know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn't know what the day would bring. I want everybody to think about this: Every time an officer walks out of his or her home and pins that badge on, a family member that they just said goodbye to wonders whether they'll—subconsciously—will they get that call. The call that his wife got. He thought he'd be coming home to his family and his seven children. But when the moment to act came, Officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in his effort to save lives. That's a definition of an American hero. And thirdly, I want to be very clear—this is the one thing I do know enough to say on it, in terms of what's happened there: While we're still waiting for more information regarding the shooter, his motive, the weapons he used—the guns, the magazines, the weapons, and the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here—I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act. We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a Senator. It passed. It was law for the longest time, and it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again. We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the ""Charleston loophole."" That's one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence. The Senate should immediately pass—let me say it again: The United States Senate—I hope some are listening—should immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not and should not be a partisan issue; this is an American issue. It will save lives—American lives—and we have to act. We should also ban assault weapons in the process. I'll have much more to say as we learn more, but I wanted to be clear: Those poor folks who died left behind families—that leaves a big hole in their hearts. And—and we can save lives increasing the background checks so that they're supposed to occur and eliminating assault weapons and the size of magazines. We don't know all the detail yet on that. But I'll be talking to you more later today or in the next couple of days about what else we know. May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because of gun violence in Colorado and Georgia and all across the country. We have to act so there's not more of you—there's fewer of you—as time goes on. Thank you so much. Gun Control Legislation  Q. Will you introduce new gun legislation, Mr. President? The President. I'll talk to you about that later. Thank you."
"Mar 23, 2021","Remarks on the 11th Anniversary of the Enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Columbus, Ohio","[The President's remarks were joined in progress.] The President's Involvement With Cancer Research Initiatives/Hazards Faced by Deployed U.S. Servicemembers  Q. Sir, is it comforting or is it hopeful or more painful for you to hear about cancer developments like this? The President. It's mostly hopeful, because I don't want to see anybody go through what my son went through. One of the things you should be aware of: There are probably more soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines coming home with brain cancers than any time in American history because of exposure. Some of you have read about the book ""Burn Pits."" There's a lot of research that still has to be done to determine whether or not exposure to these toxins in the air have had something to do with it. Also, you have an awful lot of these IEDs have caused trauma—brain trauma in other ways as well. So it really is something that I think is going to encourage us to spend a lot more time in the Government focusing on. A little bit like, you know, what used to have to with Agent Orange: You'd have to prove that, even though you were drenched in it and it rained on you, that whatever your problem was, was a consequence of that. It was very hard to prove. I finally got a bill passed, as a Senator, saying, if you were drenched, you're automatically assumed, whatever your problem is, related to that. Same thing now with an IED. If you were near a concussion, you have a problem with brain—it's assumed the Government has responsibility for it. And—but there's a lot going on, and the doc could tell you more. But something that really excites me, Doc, is the idea that we're moving into potential immunotherapy initiatives that—what they did with Beau, they injected an adenovirus into the brain. Radiation Oncology Department Chair Arnab Chakravarti. Yes. Exactly. The President. And it—they were—they were giddy, initially, at all of the—the human body coming in to eat up the virus, but it just kept going. And because there had been some damage from radiation on a blood vessel, it—things got—it didn't work. But there's real hope for people. There's real hope. Dr. Chakravarti. And, Mr. President, with this FLASH therapy, there's more—much more synergism with immune therapy than with conventional radiation—— The President. Yes, I agree with that. Dr. Chakravarti. ——we're finding. The President. Not that I agree. I don't mean like—as if I—matters what I agree on. Dr. Chakravarti. And our Proton Center, which will be—will treat our first patient 2023—will have FLASH capabilities. So it will combine the benefits of protons, FLASH, and immunotherapy together. So—— The President. Explain the difference between a proton and radiation going to—— Dr. Chakravarti. Yes, great question. Great question. The President. It's really important. Dr. Chakravarti. Yes. So with conventional radiation therapy, like this unit right behind you, sir, this produces high-level X-ray energy radiation that's penetrative. It goes through normal tissues as well as tumor. So everything is treated: normal tissues and tumor together. With proton therapy, the dose stops right at the tumor so you're not treating normal tissues. So it's a major advancement in the treatment of cancers. The President. And treating normal tissue sometimes is a very bad thing. Just—it also—it can destroy the normal tissue. It can destroy the cancer—hit that—but it goes through the cancer and destroys whatever is beyond it. Not just in the brain, but wherever that is. And so that's why I think some of the—a few of the Nobel laureates on my cancer facility are—would argue that we should get—we should start to focus on proton. Dr. Chakravarti. Yes. The President. And because it doesn't have the same application, but it does less damage when it occurs—when there is damage done. And—but it really is one of my regrets of becoming President: I had to give up the Biden Cancer Initiative, because I couldn't raise any money for it. But we proposed—there's literally six Nobel laureates on the board. A group of people that are like the Doc. I tried—I almost called you to ask for you—it's a long story but—— Dr. Chakravarti. Yes, yes. The President. And—but it is something that there's a lot—these guys are on the edge of so many things. Think about it: Jimmy Carter was declared basically gone 5 times. Obviously, he's in trouble now, but it's amazing that—you know, it's a little bit like—it's why you should never give up hope. When the breakthrough comes, it just comes through. Not planned—it's just, ""Whoa, we've got it."" Dr. Chakravarti. Yes. The President. Anyway. I'm talking too much. Gun Control Legislation  Q. Mr. President, do you believe you have the political capital to make changes on gun measures right now? The President. I hope so. Q. Are you—— The President. I don't know. I haven't done any counting yet. [The tour continued, and no transcript was provided.]"
"Mar 23, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters in Columbus, Ohio","The President. Tameka, thank you very much. I guess I'm supposed to keep this on, correct? Yes. So—good afternoon, almost getting into evening. Before I begin, as the Congresswoman said, earlier today at the White House, I addressed the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado. While the investigation is ongoing—and I spent time on the telephone with the Attorney General, as well as the head of the FBI, this—the investigation is still ongoing. My heart goes out to the families of the victims and the survivors. I want to commend the heroic actions of Officer Eric Talley, the father of seven children, who left for work yesterday morning assuming he'd be able to go home—and for the ultimate sacrifice for others. Now, let me turn to why I came today: to talk about, initially, the American Rescue Plan and the progress we're making on tackling COVID. Tameka, thank you for sharing your stories and what you're doing—my daughter is also a social worker, and you have a profound impact on people's lives—and all you do to connect folks here in Ohio with the coverage and care they need. I want to thank Joyce, Congresswoman, for sticking with me during the day, and Marcy, my old friend—good to see you, Marcy. Thanks for being here. And Tim Ryan. I always kid with Tim. If you're—if I got to be in a foxhole, he's the guy I want to be with. [Laughter] He always keeps his word, does exactly what he says he's going to do. And it's great seeing you, Tim. My best to the family. And Madam President, thanks for having served in the Obama-Biden administration, and you're doing an incredible job here. And all of the docs that are here that I got a chance to meet with today: Thank you. You are—you're an incredible group of individuals. I also want thank Sherrod Brown, who wanted to be here today, but he had to be in Washington to cast important votes in the United States Senate. Look, I want everyone to be aware that there are three key parts to the American Rescue Plan all of my colleagues supported here. First, we're going to more rapidly acquire—and we set out to more rapidly acquire enough vaccine to vaccinate every single American quicker than anticipated. And what my COVID team and—went through—and with the use of the Defense Production Act, we've been able to organize and help increase the number of doses in a much shorter time. So, by the end of May, we're going to have on hand roughly 600 million doses, enough for every American. And the American Rescue Plan is also going to provide the funding for more vaccinations, vaccination sites, vaccinators, and the paraphernalia needed to put that vaccine in one's arm. In addition, there is a second important piece of that plan. It's focused on dealing with the economic deprivation so many Americans have become subject to, a consequence to this virus, through no fault of their own. Millions have lost their jobs, and they're still out of work. Around 11 million children in America are going hungry through no fault of their own. But as a result of the pandemic and the economic crisis, millions of Americans are not able to maintain their mortgage payments or rental payments and have found themselves on the verge of being evicted and having their homes repossessed. But we stepped in, and we prevented that from happening with the American Rescue Plan. Hundreds of thousands of businesses are now—not going to go under, but they're going to have an idea—an opportunity to reopen and have the financial assistance to be able to do it the right way and safely. Schools closed and children losing up to a year or more in learning capacity. You're ahead of the States here in Ohio, but, across the Nation, the help was badly needed, and we've now provided the funding for that. Because of isolation—and violence against women is up; abuse of children is up—and the need for mental health problems—to deal with mental health problems and the consequence of them is up, as a consequence of COVID. And, in addition to that, suicides are up. The second—so, second, the American Rescue Plan brings relief to a population that's badly hurting. And one more element of our response is that—first and foremost, is the commitment to get Americans a $1,400 check per person, including per child. So a firefighter and school teacher making $120,000 combined, with two kids, are going to get a $5,600 in cash. If they already have an account online with the IRS, which many do, by tomorrow, we will have distributed 100 million of those checks just since the legislation passed. We're on the verge of doing that as of tomorrow. But for someone who doesn't have direct deposit, they're getting a check in the mail for all of that. So we expand the child—we also expanded the Childcare Tax Credit. Right now, if you file your Federal income tax, you'll get to a $2,000 deduction for every child you have. But if you're making the minimum wage, you don't earn enough to file for Federal taxes. But because of the American Rescue Plan, if you have two children, for example, under the age of 6, you're going to get a check for $3,600 if you have a child. And so, if you have two children, $7,200 will be paid on a monthly basis. This is going to be life changing. It's estimated this will do more to end child poverty in America than anything we've ever done. There's also the Earned Income Tax Credit. If you are over the age of 19 and not a full-time student and you are a childless worker, now you will get a check for $1,500 if you file. Small businesses not only will be able to borrow money to keep business afloat, but get loan forgiveness in improving your business to get us back in the game. And by the way, all of this—economists left, right, and center argue and acknowledge—will create 7 million more jobs and increase economic growth. Increase economic growth. There's so much more, but help is here. But I'm here in this great hospital to talk about a third way to help. And that is for your health—the third type of help, and that's health care. I just concluded a tour of the Radiation Oncology Department here at the James Cancer Center, which was expanded thanks to a $100 million grant in the Affordable Care Act that Sherrod Brown was instrumental in making happen. That's in addition to the research funding Ohio State received under the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. Because of our investments, this department has gone from being able to treat 60 to 70 patients a day to nearly 300 a day. This place is a source of hope. I have said that I want to—when I ran, I said I wanted to be a President who would preside over the end of cancer as we know it. And when we see the strides we've made—you talk to the docs and researchers—I can tell you, it's within our reach. We're all benefited from the breakthroughs pioneered by the Defense Department, for example, research agency called DARPA, which helped bring us everything from the internet to GPS. Well, I'm going to be proposing to my friends in Congress that we launch a similar operation at the Department of—at the Department of Health—a new effort called ""ARPA-H""—to deliver health breakthroughs to find cures for cancer and other diseases by investing billions of dollars that companies are not willing to do—drug companies are not—don't have the capacity. And I know we can do this. And I know we can find great breakthroughs. America does big things. Eleven years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, historic achievement that would not have been possible but for the vision and determination of one of the most successful Presidents in recent American history: Barack Obama. I might note, parenthetically, when I got in the automobile to go over to the—to HHS, he was laughing. I didn't know what he was laughing about. And he said: ""Did you hear? They picked up what you said on the mike."" All I could think was, ""Thank God my mother wasn't around to hear it."" [Laughter] But look, on this anniversary, we should remember just how close we have come to losing that act we so fought so hard for. And we have a duty not just to protect it, but to make it better and keep becoming a nation where health care is a right for all and not a privilege for a few. When I ran for President, I promised I would build on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act. And just 50 days into my administration, we've delivered on that promise with the American Rescue Plan. It does that by making health care more affordable. It means better coverage and lower premiums for millions of Americans. If you're enrolled in Obamacare, you're going to save an average of $50 a month—$600 a year—by the reduction of payments. For a family of four earning $90,000 a year, that could save you $200 a month in savings. For a 60-year-old couple here in Ohio earning $75,000 per year, it could save them about $1,000 per month and to maintain this health—same health care. That's $12,000 a year in your pocket that you didn't have before. Because of the American Rescue Plan, if you lost health care because you lost your job or your hours were cut, we pay your contribution and your employer's contribution under the so-called COBRA. That's what your employer-based health insurance was. And so since—if they've gone out of business or you're no longer there because you had to be laid off, you can stay covered for up to 6 months until you get back on your feet, because, we'll—the Federal Government will cover both ends of that COBRA payment. For millions who are out of work and have no coverage, thanks to this law, there's an Obamacare plan that most folks can get with zero-dollar premiums. Copays will still be there, but zero-dollar premiums. Four out of five Americans shopping on the Obamacare marketplace can get quality health care with a premium of $10 a month or less. Let me say that again: Four out of five Americans who shop for a plan will find one for $10 or less per month. It's especially important in communities that historically have gone without insurance at higher rates. Very few communities that have always faced health disparities—Black, Brown, and Asian, Native American communities—have borne the brunt of the COVID crisis. And we're also making it easy to—easier to sign up for Obamacare. We've opened healthcare.gov for special enrollments on February the 15. In the first 2 weeks alone, more than 200,000 Americans gained coverage. Today I'm pleased to announce that we've extended that period to run through August the 15th. Just go to healthcare.gov or call the national hotline: 1-800-318-2596. That's 1-800-318-2596. A few clicks and a short conversation—that's all it takes to start seeing these benefits of increased coverage and lower premiums. I'll close with this: With the American Rescue Plan and the Affordable Care Act, millions of families will be able to sleep a little more soundly at night because they don't have to worry about losing everything if they get sick. I, like many of you, grew up in a middle class—I guess, technically, lower middle class—household based on outcome. We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with four kids and our grandpop living with us. And the paper—the walls were paper-thin. I can remember lying in bed and hearing my dad rolling back and forth, and I could tell there was something wrong. I remember asking my mom the next morning, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said: ""Honey, he's just worried. We just lost our health insurance. He no longer has his coverage."" People lying in bed wondering: ""My God, what happens? What happens if, in fact, I get sick? What happens if I turn and she has breast cancer or I end up with a heart condition? What happens?"" And God forbid you're sitting on the edge of a hospital bed with someone you love—like I did with my son Beau as he was dying, and all you have to think about is—all they have they have to think about is getting better, not what happens if an insurance company can come in, like they did before Obamacare, and say, ""Sorry, you've outrun your coverage."" I used to sit there and think: ""My God, what would happen? What would I do?"" That's the difference. And we're going to keep building until every American has that peace of mind and to show that our Government can fulfill its most essential purpose: to care for and protect the American people. When we work together, we can do big things, important things, necessary things. We saw it 11 years ago with the Affordable Care Act. We saw it 11 days ago when we marked the signing of the American Rescue Plan. But we're not done yet. Last week, we met my goal that I announced of administering 100 million shots in my first 100 days in office. At the time, the press said that's awfully ""audacious."" Now that we've done it in 58 days, they're saying, ""Boy, he sure set the bar awful low."" Well, this week, we're announcing a new goal: to get more people vaccinated. But we need all Americans to keep washing their hands, staying socially distanced, and wearing the mask when you're in public, as recommended by the CDC. And get vaccinated when it's your turn. It's a patriotic responsibility you have. Now is not the time to let down our guard. If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America; that there's nothing we have—cannot do if we do it together. We're going to beat this pandemic. And because of the great docs up this staircase here, we're going to beat cancer as we know it as well. We're going to make sure, once and for all, that health care is a right, not a privilege, in this Nation. So I want to say to, again, the docs who spent the day with me, all the incredible work you're doing—I told them that when my son contracted stage-four glioblastoma when coming home from Iraq—when he was in Iraq, that I had the opportunity—the President asked me to do what they called a Cancer Moonshoot. I put together an organization made up of seven Nobel laureates, as well as another 30 docs in the cancer field, and I was able to go and visit every major cancer facility in the world save one. And we have some of the finest minds in the world, and they're right here: right here at Ohio State, right here in Ohio, right here in the United States of America. And they break their necks every single day for us. We owe them. I want to thank you all. May God bless you, may God bless us all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you for the hospitality."
"Mar 24, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters Upon Arrival From Joint Base Andrews, Maryland","The President's Briefing  Q. Were you getting a briefing, Mr. President? The President. Yes, I was. Q. Can you share what's going on? The President. It was a foreign policy issue. The Composition of the President's Cabinet  Q. Mr. President, a couple of Asian American Senators have threatened to veto your nominees if you don't nominate diverse candidates. Have you spoken to them? The President. Well, I don't know what you're—— Q. An Asian American in your Cabinet, sir, is what they're asking for. The President. We have the most diverse Cabinet in history. We have a lot of Asian Americans who are in the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet levels. Our Cabinet is formed. Border Security/Immigration Policy  Q. Mr. President, are you concerned that the administration's statements that the border is closed, but children will be cared for, is a mixed message? The President. I'll have more to say about that in the next couple of days. The key here relates to what's happening in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And the last administration dismantled all we had put in place, relative to dealing with the problems in country. And we'll have something to say about that very shortly. Q. Is Ambassador Jacobson—is she trying to get some concessions from Guatemala and El Salvador? The President. I'll more to say about that tomorrow and the next day. North Korea/Short-Range Missile Tests in North Korea  Q. Could you tell you—us about North Korea and firing of the rockets—what you've learned? The President. We have learned that there is nothing much has changed. Thank you."

The President. You know, I can't hear a word you're saying. Q. Can Americans feel confident in the AstraZeneca vaccine? The President. I haven't gotten the final report today. We haven't used it at all. We have it available, but we haven't used it. And I don't know what's—I've been gone all day. I don't know what's happened today. Q. Have you spoken to Dr. Fauci about it?

Will you increase the number of doses you're going to give Mexicans and Canadians? The President. Well, that depends on how the—what is finally approved. Okay? Thank you. North Korea/Short-Range Missile Tests in North Korea  Q. On North Korea, sir: Do you consider that to be a real provocation by North Korea, the missile launch? The President. No. According to the Defense Department, it's business as usual. There's no new—there's no new wrinkle in what they did. Q. Does it affect diplomacy at all? [Laughter] Q. What do you think about gun legislation?"
"Mar 24, 2021",Remarks on Equal Pay Day,"The President. Well folks, today I have two announcements to make. One is, we've got ourselves a Secretary. Xavier, welcome. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thanks for being willing to do this, and I really appreciate it. And also today, I've—I said when we became a team and got elected that the Vice President was going to be the last person in the room. She didn't realize that means she gets every assignment. [Laughter] But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to pass the legislation that is going to beat this virus, as well as get people back to work and change their prospects. And so she's traveling all over the country working that. In addition to that, there's about five other major things she's handling, but I've asked her, the VP, today—because she's the most qualified person to do it—to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help—are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border. And you know, back when I was Vice President, I got a similar assignment, but one of the things we did was, we made sure that we got a bipartisan agreement with Democrats and Republicans to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle to determine the best way to keep people from coming is keep them from wanting to leave. And the reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking and cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes. And so it's not like someone sits around a hand-hewn table somewhere in Guatemala and says: ""I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have him take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in the desert. We don't speak the language. Won't that be fun?"" And one of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone. It benefits us, it benefits the people, and it grows the economies there. Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding—did not engage in it, did not use it—even though there was over $700 million to help get this done. We're reinstituting that program. And there are—as I said, there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place. But this is the source of one of the reasons why we've had such a—before we took office, in the midst of the last administration's somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we found that there were a serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that. And as Alejandro can tell you, is that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries. They were coming north, and we did nothing to do any—much about it. So this new surge we're dealing with now started with the last administration, but it's our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop what's happening. And so this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President has agreed—among the multiple other things that I have her leading—and I appreciate it—agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders—at their borders. We're already talking with Mexico about that; she's already done that. We're going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country. And I can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this than a former—this is a woman who ran the second largest attorney general's office in America—after the U.S.—after the United States Attorney General—in the State of California and has done a great deal upholding human rights, but also fighting organized crime in the process. So it's not her full responsibility and job, but she's leading the effort, because I think the best thing to do is to put someone who, when he or she speaks, they don't have to wonder about is that where the President is. When she speaks, she speaks for me. Doesn't have to check with me. She knows what she's doing, and I hope we can move this along. But—so, Madam Vice President, thank you. I gave you a tough job, and you're smiling, but there's no one better capable of trying to organize this for us. Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Well, thank you, Mr. President and for having the confidence in me. And there's no question that this is a challenging situation. As the President has said, there are many factors that lead precedent to leave these countries. And while we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also—because we can chew gum and walk at the same time—must address the root causes that cause people to make the trek, as the President has described, to come here. And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society, and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the Western hemisphere. And as part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share. I also look forward to working with Members of the Congress who, I think, share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we've been seeing. And needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It is work that we demand—and the people of our countries, I believe, need—to help stem the tide that we have seen. So thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence. Thank you. The President. Well, thank you for willing to do it. Now we're going to get down to business here. And, Ron, who am I turning this over to?"
"Mar 26, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters in New Castle, Delaware","The President. Well, good afternoon, everyone. Megan and Margaret, thank you. Thank you for being here. And to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well. I'm an unadulterated fan. [Laughter] Not a joke. Not a joke. And both of you and your entire team—I'm not joking—have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, I might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time All-State; my niece, All-American. There's a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the women's side of the equation. [Laughter] But I—really, thank you for what you've done. You know, you're all heroes for so many people—and that's not hyperbole to suggest that—on and off the field. You know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years. Megan, it's hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign. I said it last April, when we spoke, and I'll say it again: The fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters. Not a joke. I went so far as I took—they might may say—a privilege of getting our granddaughter Maisy, who is a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania—up taking a course right now—I got her on the phone so she—all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually. And she's a soccer player. And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country. And I didn't bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field—[laughter]—no, I'm serious—and off the field. You all made me a hero with my granddaughters. And the reason we're here today is because it's Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years. It was declared 25 years ago—Equal Pay Day—though not enough people know about that and they—as they should. You know, it's a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year. That's what Jill was talking about. And it's shocking when you look at the numbers. Twelve years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was standing at our side. This year—that year, I should say, in 2009, we marked—Equal Pay Day occurred in late April. By late April, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months. They had to go all the way through January, February, March, and April to catch up. That meant that it took women until April of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008. Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12. And more than 3 extra months—it's more than that. And it's even longer for women of color. And it's wrong. This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much: from late April to late March. And frankly, we shouldn't be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all. The reality, though, is that in nearly every job—more than 90 percent of the occupations—women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average. For AAPI women, it's 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns. For Black women, it's 63 cents. For Native American women, it's 60 cents. For Hispanic women, it's 55 cents. It doesn't matter if you're an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real. And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay. You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they're still earning less. More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started—2 million. And now we're at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we've been in more than 30 years. Let me say it again: The lowest percent of women in the workforce—had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today. A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders. It causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones. That in and of itself sows some discrimination. How many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman's staying in the workforce? It undermines financial security. And, by the way, it's hard. I was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago. And the fact of the matter is, I was a U.S. Senator. I was 29 years old. I was making $42,000 a year, and I couldn't afford help to take care of my kids while I worked. Thankful—thankfully, my mother—my sister gave up her job. My brother—they helped me raise my kids. It undermines financial security for women and families. It hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people. In the American Rescue Plan you've heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge. It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of American households. The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way. It also expanded the childcare tax credit. And here's what that means, for those who don't know: Right now, if you file for Federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child. But if you need help the most, if you're making a minimum wage job and you don't have to—you don't make enough to pay Federal income tax, then you don't get this credit. But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you're making $7.25 an hour—which is the minimum wage that so many people are making—you'll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200. Roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the Federal Government. That's life-changing. The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31 percent. And that's a significant lift up for women. The law provides $360 billion for funding State and local governments. What that means is that's going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women—nurses, teachers, health care workers, home health care aides—because the States have to balance their budget, because if they can't—because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the Federal Government—they'll have to lay off those essential workers. And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for—invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic. All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families. But there's so much more we need to do. So much more. We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities. It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination. It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group. It would increase pay transparency. By that, I mean, you know, there's a whole range of American corporations—if you sign the Fortune 500—you sign up with them, you cannot reveal—it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee. Why is that? They don't want me sitting there saying, ""Well, I'm making $60,000."" And the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said: ""You're making 60? I'm making 40."" They actually try to hide it. That's what I mean by transparency. Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like I said, how much the person sitting next to you is making. Some may even discipline you for asking that. That has to change. Too often, secrecy is part of the problem. We know information is power. You can't solve the problem if you don't know you're not getting paid fairly. My administration is going to fight for equal pay—for it to become a reality for all women. It's about justice. It's about fairness. It's about living up to our values and who we are as a nation. Equal pay makes all of us stronger. It's not just women who care about this. I've been around the country. I've gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, ""How many of you—how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn't earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?"" And you hear them say—you hear them respond, they don't like it. Why? When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she's standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it. You can get four new tires on the car. It means everybody's life is made better in that family. Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women's wages even more than they lift men's; and by investing our care—in our care infrastructure—our care infrastructure—in paid leave, childcare, homecare—so that people can care for their families and also go to work. There's a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons. And if we're able to do this, it will be transformational for our Nation. That's the goal. That's what this is all about. That's what this team, all of you, are all about. Let me make one more point. You know, I've told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what I was saying—and I mean it: There's not a single thing a man can do that a woman can't do as well or better. Not a single thing. I was among the first Senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval Academy. I was just able to, as President of the United States, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders. Three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they're women. Women. There are so many, some in the Congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound. So many doing so much. But this soccer team, America's team, has done more to lift up people's sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that's been done. So, as President of the United States, I thank you. I thank you for the example you've set and for your willingness to say: ""Look, we're not going to take it anymore. We're not going to take it."" Figuratively speaking, ""You can take my trophies, but you can't take my pride."" As I said, my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is""—when he lost his job and had to get another one. We had to move. He'd say: ""You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your sense of yourself and your self-worth. It's about your place in the community."" That's what this is all about, and that's why you guys are leading the way. And now it's my great pleasure and honor—I'd like you to stand next to me, if you would, while I sign a Proclamation making Equal Pay Day—naming it—an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth. Thank you, folks. I'm going to sign it now. Come on over here. The title of the proclamation is ""National Equal Pay Day, 2021."" First Lady Jill T. Biden. You can move up. [Laughter] U.S. Women's National Soccer Team forward Megan A. Rapinoe. I'm checking. Just making sure it says what it says. [Laughter] The President. That's what it says. Ms. Rapinoe. I know. Joseph R. Biden. The President. Junior. [Laughter] Ms. Rapinoe. Junior. Junior. The President. My dad. He was a fine man. It says ""Equal pay is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance equal—equality and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential."" Like you guys. The First Lady. Thank you. The President. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. The First Lady. Thank you."

Any theories on the origins of the coronavirus in—— The President. No, no, I don't. I have theories, but I'm not a scientist. I'm going to wait until the scientific community makes that judgment. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom/North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Q. You spoke to the British Prime Minister. What was the conversation about? The President. Well, we talked a lot about climate change. We talked a lot about the need also for Britain and the United States to stand together and deal with the whole notion of whether or not NATO stands together, whether we stand united and whether or not I'd be able to come, and I hope I can, to the NATO meeting in—I think it's in late June. So we talked about scheduling and when I'd come over and how we'd work that out. Q. Any commitments on either side during the call? The President. No, there was full agreement. One of the things I suggested to do is—we talked about China and the competition they're engaging in in the Belt and Road Initiative. And I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative coming from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help. The President's Grandson Beau Biden, Jr.  Q. What does it mean to have Baby Beau on the plane with you, on Air Force One? The President. [Laughter] It's really great. It's really—— Georgia's Election Legislation  Q. President Biden, you issued strong words about the Georgia voting bill—— The President. Not as strong as I was really thinking. Q. Is there anything the White House can do to protect voting rights in Georgia? The President. Well, we're working on that right now. We don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point. The Justice Department is taking a look as well. Use of the Filibuster in the Senate  Q. Mr. President, how does the voting issue affect your thinking on the filibuster? The President. Well, look, we'll see. The question is whether or not—you know, you have to have 50 votes—51 votes to have to win to be able to move the filibuster and any change in the filibuster. And right now that doesn't exist. That doesn't exist. So, you know, look, I—the only thing I've been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move. You've got to have the votes. Executive Action on Gun Safety Regulation  Q. [Inaudible]—gun control? Q. Can we expect any gun control Executive orders? The President. Pardon me? Q. Can we expect any gun control Executive orders soon? The President. Well, we're looking at that right now. We're looking at what kind of authority I have relative to imported weapons, as well as whether or not I have any authority to—these new weapons that are being made by 3-D equipment that aren't registered as guns at all, there may be some latitude there as well. Q. [Inaudible] The President. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Blocked Shipping Lanes in the Suez Canal, Egypt  Q. On the Suez Canal, sir. On the Suez Canal, what offer has the DOD, has the Pentagon made to help Egypt? Can you say? What all can the U.S. do to assist? The President.

I truly apologize to everybody, especially on a Friday afternoon, as the mayor said. I want to thank the mayor for her leadership, and more importantly, I want to thank her for her friendship. And for everyone on this call, you should know that Keisha endorsed me, as I said, very early in my campaign, back when most folks didn't think I had a chance. She stuck with me when things were bad and—[inaudible]. But through it all, she believed in me, and I'm forever grateful. But maybe the person I should be thanking most is Keisha's mom. Keisha often tells me stories about how her best polling source is her mom and what her mom is hearing about at the bridge club every Saturday. Well, when Keisha's mom said she believed in me, I guess that was good enough for Keisha. And just like she had my back, I have hers. And we need her, and Atlanta needs her. You know, we saw it just weeks after—just weeks after we found ourselves—[inaudible]—to the mass shooting. When the Vice President—when I—when the Vice President and I traveled to Atlanta, we met with the mayor and saw her strength keeping the city together, especially for the Asian American community that remains in fear and is hurting right now. And we've seen her leadership during this pandemic, believing in science and leading a city that's home to a tremendous public servant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. We saw her stand tall and speak out during the summer of protests and pain. And during the campaign that tested our very democracy, she was always there. So many of you stepped up as well. And if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved that it did. If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia proved it 11,779 times. And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved that. And if you're wondering whether Republican officials will finally stop their attacks on the right to vote and actually try and win over votes, they just proved yesterday they won't. It's—[inaudible]—America and what they're doing—that it cannot stand. So, above all, Keisha knows democracy is not just about winning elections. It's about governing, making government work. It's about making government work for working families, for the people who are the backbone of this country. And that's why we fought so hard to pass the American Rescue Plan. It's making a difference. Just last week, we passed 100 million shots in arms in the first 58 days in office. We're going to get—[inaudible]—200 million in my first 100 days. That includes a $10 billion investment to make sure we reach the hardest hit and highest risk communities. And yesterday we reached 100 million checks for $1,400 into people's pockets and their bank accounts. By the time this money is distributed, 88 percent of all adults and children in Georgia will receive such a check. That's going to change their lives. The American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty literally in half, including for 171,000 Georgia children. It provides $4 billion for Georgia's schoolchildren, in grades K through 12, to keep them open and keep them open safely. And one of the biggest things for Georgia and the Atlantic—and Atlanta: Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion in expanded Medicaid. That means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across the State with Medicaid that they don't have right now. And that's on top of the lower premiums and expanded coverage, if you have a plan through Obamacare. Your State—the State of Georgia—will also get around $5 billion to make up for the lost revenues. Local governments will get around $3.5 billion. That's going to make it possible to keep police officers, firefighters, teachers, first responders on the job, rather than have to lay them off because of a lack of funding. And who is going to deliver this help on the ground? The mayor. The mayor. But that's just the beginning. And as we rescue the economy in the coming weeks, I'll be laying out my vision for a Build Back Better plan to rebuild America's own 21st century, modernizing our infrastructure: our transportation systems, our broadband systems, our water and power systems. And we're going to make historic investments in research and development, and we're going to create millions—and it's not just me; it's not just a Democratic think tank. Wall Street has pointed out millions of good-paying jobs here in America—manufacturing, clean energy, and so much more. Just manufacturing in general. A big piece of that, as the mayor knows and as I promised on the campaign, is historic investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to help the next generation of Black students get access to good-paying jobs now and in the future. We're also going to invest in our families, making—[inaudible]—housing more affordable, and caregiving economy stronger for millions of Americans, mostly women and women of color who care for children and aging loved ones. And they deserve to be paid well. All this is going to help us outcompete the rest of the world, and it will depend on government being able to work for the American people. That's why I need people like Keisha leading the way, and I really mean that. I'm going to close with this—I've kept you too long already: There is so much we can do if we do it together, if we stand together; if we once again believe and invest in science; if we stand up for justice and equality and the right of Americans to vote and have access to voting. And Keisha is leading our efforts as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. You have to remember, we're here to help all the people of this country, the bottom up and the middle out, not just those in the top few. Folks, if we do that, then there's not a single solitary thing we can't do if we do it together. So to Keisha and to all of you, I apologize for the mixup. I'm not—I don't want to be fastidious about making sure—[inaudible]—to do this. So I'm—[inaudible]—home, and we just got a little messed up here. But I truly apologize. And I—and again, let me thank all of you who—that we called on our contribution list, asking about Keisha—[inaudible]—coming through. She is the real deal. She's bright. She's honorable. She's tough. She has great integrity. And it really matters that we have people like Keisha to—[inaudible]. So, Keisha, I want to thank you as well for being my buddy. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Have a good weekend. Thank you."

Have you made a final decision on how you're going to approach your legislative agenda? Is it going to be one bill, or are you going to split it up into multiple bills? The President. I have, but I ain't telling you. [Laughter] Political Unrest and Violence in Burma  Q. Any reaction to what happened in Myanmar? The President. It's terrible. It's absolutely outrageous. And based on the reporting I've gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed, totally unnecessarily. Gun Control Legislation  Q. Senator Chris Murphy said today that he thinks there's a chance to get 60 votes for a background check proposal. Are you prepared to make calls for—to Republicans to try to get it over the finish line? The President. Sure, I am. Of course, I am. I'm the only one that's ever gotten it passed, man. Everybody keeps wondering whether I cared about dealing with rational gun control. The only gun control legislation ever passed was mine. It's going to happen again. Cybersecurity  Q.

"Mar 30, 2021",Remarks on Signing of the PPP Extension Act of 2021,"The President. Good afternoon. Last week, we set a goal of 200 million shots by day 100 of our administration, double the original goal that I had said. And to make that progress, over the last 3 days, we've had a record number of shots in arms with over 10 million shots recorded in the weekend. Over 10 million shots in 3 days—that would have been inconceivable in January. The progress we've made on vaccinating this country is a great American story. The Federal Government has stepped up, taken responsibility, and launched a massive Federal vaccination program. Governors and mayors of both political parties—Republicans and Democrats—have stepped up as well. Our military, our National Guard, FEMA—they have all been incredible. Health care providers, community leaders from all walks of life, so many volunteers of all ages and backgrounds stepped up as well. And my fellow Americans, look at what we have done the past 10 weeks. No other country has come close: 100 million shots in less than 60 days, and now we're moving on to the next 100 million shots in just 40 days. You've heard me say it many times before: Our progress on vaccination is a stunning example that there is nothing—nothing—this country cannot do if we put our minds to it and we do it together. But as I've also said, I will always give you it straight, straight from the shoulder. Our work is far from over. The war against COVID-19 is far from won. This is deadly serious. We share the sentiment of Dr. Walensky, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC expressed earlier today: This is not the time to lessen our efforts. That's what she said. We could still see a setback in the vaccination program. And most importantly, if we let our guard down now, we could see a virus getting worse, not better. You know, as many people as we have vaccinated, we still have more Americans left to go. You know, we will administer more shots in March than any country on Earth. But even so, we have to give more shots in April than we did in March. Because we're in the life-and-death race for the virus that is spreading quickly with cases rising again. New variants are spreading. And sadly, some of the reckless behavior we've seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead. With vaccines, there's hope, which is a—which is a very good thing, to state the obvious. But people are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing. Look, to this point, cases have fallen two-thirds since I took office. Deaths have also fallen two-thirds. But now cases are going back up, and in some States, deaths are as well. You know, we're giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains. And as much as we are doing, America, it is time to do even more. All of us have to do our part, every one of us. So let me start here: First, this week, thanks to my administration's intensive work with vaccine manufacturers and distribution efforts, the amount of vaccines that are going to be available for vaccinators—vaccination sites will be a new record: 33 million doses of vaccine this week. By getting more vaccine supply to States, community health centers, and pharmacies, we can vaccinate the highest risk Americans even more quickly than we already are. And then, we make it possible to open up supplies for all adults and to try to beat the renewed spread of this virus. As a result, I'm also pleased to announce that we're on track this week—just 10 weeks after I became President—to achieve nearly 75 percent of Americans over the age of 65 getting at least one vaccination shot. When I took office on January 20, that number was 8 percent. It's going to 75 percent. That's a lot of grandparents who are now able to safely hug their grandchildren, and they couldn't do so just a short time ago. And with the supply we're releasing this week—just this week alone—there are more doors—there are more doses of vaccine available for seniors this week than any week thus far. So, seniors, please, if you have not gotten your shot yet, get it this week. Get it. Second, I'm reiterating my call for every Governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate. Please, this is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously—precisely what got us in this mess in the first place—risks more cases and more deaths. Look, as I do my part to accelerate the vaccine distribution and vaccinations, I need the American people to do their part as well. Mask up. Mask up. It's a patriotic duty. It's the only way we ever get back to normal: to cheer together in stadiums full of fans; to gather together on holidays again safely; go to graduations, weddings. Third, I announced on March 11 I'd direct every State, Territory, and Tribe to open up their vaccinations to all adults no later than May 1. I issued that order because moving beyond priority groups to enable all adults to get vaccinated is critical to having a July 4 that's closer to normal. I want this to come as quickly as possible. And I want to thank the Governors—Democrats and Republicans—who have responded to this directive. In fact, the vast majority of Governors have set open access dates even earlier than the deadline of May 1. But in this race against the rapidly spreading virus, as fast as we are going, we need to go faster. So to make it easier for Americans to get vaccinated as the supply grows and vaccination eligibility expands, I'm directing my COVID team to ensure there is a vaccine site within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans by April the 19th, 3 weeks from today. Look, we're going to do this by growing from having 17,000 pharmacies giving out vaccination shots to nearly 40,000 pharmacies doing it within the next 3 weeks. That will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can go get vaccinated. But we aren't stopping there. In the next 3 weeks, we'll add 12 more Federally run mass vaccination sites. Every day at these sites, tens of thousands of people are able to drive up, get a vaccine shot while in their car, and leave in less than an hour. And over 60 percent of the shots given at these sites goes to minority communities because they're in minority communities. We have to reach out. They're the ones most affected by the vaccine—by both the vaccine, but also by the pandemic. We're also going to send more aid to States to expand the opening of more community vaccination sites—more vaccines, more sites, more vaccinators—all designed to speed our critical work. But we also need to make it easier for those who want shots but cannot access vaccination sites to get vaccinated. This is also where we're focused on the seniors most immediately. While we have made incredible progress in starting to vaccinate nearly three-quarters of our seniors and now putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans, that still isn't enough as far as we're concerned. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities who may be isolated and have lack of access to transportation, and there are community groups that can help. They're trying to help now. So our fourth announcement today is that I'm sending out millions of dollars, through the Department of Health and Human Service, to provide assistance, including transportation, so more vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities can get their shots, because they get help to physically get there, to get the shot. Neighbors helping neighbors: What a truly American effort. We cannot let transportation be a barrier to any senior getting a vaccination. And so where does this put us? We're making progress on vaccinations, but cases are rising, and the virus is spreading in too many places still. That's why, today, I'm taking these steps to make our American turnaround story a—our vaccination program move even faster. Thanks to all the work we've done these past 10 weeks, the added steps I'm announcing today—with them—I'm pleased to announce that at least 90 percent of all adults in this country will be eligible to be vaccinated by April the 19th, just 3 weeks from now, because we have the vaccines. For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won't have to wait till May 1. You'll be eligible for your shot on April 19. Finally, 10 percent will be eligible no later than—the final 10 percent will be eligible no later than May 1. And as I just said, due to the steps we're taking today, 90 percent of Americans will be within 5 miles of a location where they can get a shot as of April the 19th. So we're moving toward ""90/90"" by April 19. That is, by April 19, 3 weeks from today, 90 percent of adults—people over 18 and over—will be eligible get vaccinated. Ninety percent of all Americans will be living within 5 miles of a place they can get a shot. And of course, it will take time for everyone to get their appointment. It's a big country. And as fast as we're going, and we still have a long way to go to finish this vaccination effort. In fact, we aren't even there—we aren't halfway yet. But being at 90/90 just 3 weeks from today should give hope to the country. Let me close with this: The progress we're making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans. But as I've always said, we still need everyone to do their part. We still are in a war with this deadly virus. And we're bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won. Together, we have so much to be proud of in the past 3 weeks—past more than 3 weeks, past 10 weeks. We also have so much to be sorrowful about. Nearly 1,000 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19 as we approach 550,000 deaths in a single year. Until this country is vaccinated, each of us has to do our part. We have an obligation—a patriotic obligation: Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, wear a mask as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated. Get your friends and family vaccinated when you can help. Now is not the time to let down. Now is not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country: our duty, our jobs; take care of one another; and fight this to the finish. We can and will do this, but don't let up now. Don't let up now. Thank you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you very much. Rise in Coronavirus Cases  Q. Mr. President, Dr. Walensky said she's scared of an ""impending doom"" with COVID cases on the rise. Are you? The President. I just explained that, I think, thoroughly. I hope I did anyway. Thank you. Coronavirus Prevention Efforts  Q. Mr. President, do you believe that some States should pause their reopening efforts? The President. Yes."
"Mar 31, 2021","Remarks on the American Jobs Plan in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","The President. Hello, everyone. How are you? I want to thank Administrator Guzman, who's running the show for us. And we're really starting to move here. And the Vice President, thank you—— Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course. The President. ——for your focus on small business. We're pushing lenders to raise their game and provide more help to small—many small businesses. As you know, particularly Hispanic, as well as African American small businesses are just out of business because they got bypassed the first time around. Today I'm proud to sign the extension, which I'm going to do in a second, of the Paycheck Protection Program. It is a bipartisan accomplishment. Nearly 90,000 business owners are still in line, and there's money left. Without somebody signing this bill today, there are hundreds of thousands of people who could lose their jobs, and small and family businesses that might close forever. And, as you know, small business is the backbone of our economy, representing almost 50 percent of all the employees in America. And I want to thank Senators Cardin, Shaheen, Rubio, and Collins for their work in the Senate—it was a bipartisan effort—and Young Kim and Velazquez, as well as Luetkemeyer for their work in the House to make sure this happened. And, the last 2 months, we've approved forgivable loans for three-thousand—excuse me, three-million-six-hundred small businesses—six-hundred-thousand small businesses. And three-million-three-hundred [thousand]* of those small businesses were less than—higher—had fewer than 20 employees, which is the backbone of most of the communities. So, with that, I'm going to sign this. And thank you all for coming. [At this point, the President signed the bill.] Thanks, folks. Enjoy yourselves."
"Apr 01, 2021",Remarks During a Videoconference on Faith and Community Engagement,"Thank you. Gov, Mike asked me—and I say to Bobby, my good friend—he asked me back there—he said, ""Do you ever get nervous?"" And I—he said, ""Because I got up this morning, made breakfast for my kids, said I've got to introduce the President.'"" And what I say to you, Mike: You did a heck of a job. But I'd get nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night, climb up a telephone pole, replace—in the middle of a storm—a connection that knocked out everybody's electricity and put a transformer in. That's what would make me nervous. So what you did was really good. I couldn't do what you do, pal. [Laughter] I couldn't do what you do. And I want to—and it's true, Mike. You're a union guy; me too. I got in trouble, but I don't make any apologies for it. I'm a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class. It's about time they start to get a piece of the action. To all my colleagues—from the county executive, to the mayor, to everyone who's here, I want to say: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman, for the passport into your district. And I appreciate being here. I'm honored to be with you. Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. And today I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that—rebuild the backbone of America. It's a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington, but through the eyes of hard-working people, like the people I grew up with; people like Mike and his union family; union workers in this Carpenters Training Center; people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware; people who get up every day, work hard, raise their family, pay their taxes, serve their country, and volunteer for their communities, and just looking for a little bit of breathing room—just a little bit of light. Ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. The people who break their necks every day for their families and the country they love—a country that, in fact—which, on the day I was elected, was in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed four thousand—excuse me, five hundred—I carry it in my pocket every day. I have the list of exactly how many have died: 547,296 Americans dead from the virus—more than all the people killed in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, 9/11. 547,296 Americans. And an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety. That's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress. I really mean that. It didn't pass by a whole lot, but with the leadership of Conor and Bobby and the mayor, and—just, you got it done, because it was an emergency. We needed to act to save jobs, to save businesses, and to save lives. And that's what we did. We're beginning to see the results. We're on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my Presidency. When I said I'd get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We're going to get 200 million done—twice the original goal—because of all the help of all of you. Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year. That's a rate we haven't seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year. With the American Rescue Plan, we're meeting immediate emergencies. Now it's time to rebuild. Even before the crisis we're now facing, those at the very top in America were doing very well, which is fine. They were doing great. But everyone else was falling behind. The pandemic only made the division so much worse and more obvious. Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year, while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their net worth increase by $4 trillion. It just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become. It wasn't always this way. Well, it's time to change that. I'd note, parenthetically, that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middle class and poor folks this last time. I didn't hear that cry—hue and cry when we were doing the same thing when Trump's tax bill passed and 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent. You know, this is not to target those who've made it, not to seek retribution. This is about opening opportunities for everybody else. And here's the truth: We all will do better when we all do well. It's time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out, not the top down. That hasn't worked very well. For the economy overall, it hasn't worked, because Wall Street didn't build this country; you, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class. And it's time—in this time, we'll rebuild the middle class. We're going to bring everybody along. Regardless of your background, your color, your religion—no matter—everybody gets to come along. So today I'm proposing a plan for the Nation that rewards work, not just rewards wealth. It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed, and it's going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world. It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges. It's a once-in-a generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. It will grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years. It's big? Yes. It's bold? Yes. And we can get it done. It has two parts: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. Both are essential to our economic future. In a few weeks, I'll talk about the Americans Family Plan, but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan. I'll begin with the heart of the plan: It modernizes transportation infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our airports. I just left your airport. The director of the airport said, ""We're about to renovate the airport."" Is that right, Mr. County Executive? ""We're going to renovate. We're going to employ thousands of people."" And she looked at me and said, ""I can't thank you enough for this plan."" It grows the economy in key ways. It puts people to work to repair and upgrade so—that we badly need. It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods, to get to work, and to make us more competitive around the world. Some of your local officials know, when someone wants to come into the area and a company wants to invest, what do they ask? ""Where's the first rail bed? How can I get to the railroad? What access to interstate do I have? What's the water like? Tell me about it."" And it goes on and on. It's about infrastructure. The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. It will fix the Nation's 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement. Remember that bridge that went down? We've got 10 of the most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it that need to be replaced. We'll also repair 10,000 bridges, desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe, and connect our cities, towns, and Tribes across the country. The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It will reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports. The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. It will protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic superstorms, floods, wildfires, droughts, year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seizing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future. Skilled workers, like one we just heard from, building a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations, creating good-paying jobs by leading the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks. We're going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future. The Federal Government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States, by American workers, with American products. When we make all these investments, we're going to make sure, as the Executive order I signed early on, that we buy American. That means investing in American-based companies and American workers. Not a contract will go out, that I control, that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products, all the way down the line, and American workers. And we'll buy the goods we need from all of America, communities that have historically been left out of these investments: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, rural, small businesses, entrepreneurs across the country. Look, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes—where they get their water from—pipes that are lead-based pipes, including pipes for drinking water. According to scientists, there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child. Lead can slow development, cause learning behaviors and hearing problems. The American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipefitters to work, replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water. With each $5,000 investment replacing a line, that can mean up to $22,000 in health care costs saved, a chance to protect our children, help them learn and thrive. We can't delay. We can't delay another minute. It's long past due. You know, in America, where the early interest was in internet—this thing called the internet that we invested—we invented, the early internet was invented here. Millions of Americans, though, lack access to reliable high-speed internet, including more than 35 percent of rural America. It's a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic. American Jobs will make sure every single—every single—American has access to high quality, affordable, high-speed internet for businesses, for schools. And when I say ""affordable,"" I mean it. Americans pay too much for internet service. We're going to drive down the price for families who have service now, and make it easier for families who don't have affordable service to be able to get it now. As you saw in Texas and elsewhere, our electrical power grids are vulnerable to storms, catastrophic failures, and security lapses, with tragic results. My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work—hundreds of thousands of people to work—line workers, electricians, and laborers—laying thousands of miles of transmission line; building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid; and capping hundreds of thousands of old, literally, orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because they're abandoned, paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place. We'll build, upgrade, and weatherize affordable, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time—the so-called ""sandwich generation""—or family members with disability. You've got a child at home, you can't stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose—you're going to put the child at risk, or you lose your job; or you have an elderly parent you're taking care of. And seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well. But we know, if they can remain independently living, they live longer. The American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways. It's going to extend access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care. Think of expanded vital services like programs for seniors, or think of homecare workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities, cooking meals, helping them get around their homes, and helping them be able to live more independently. For too long, caregivers—who are disproportionately women and women of color and immigrants—have been unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. This plan, along with the American Families Plan, changes that with better wages, benefits, and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them. You know, decades ago, the United States Government used to spend 2 percent of its GDP—its gross domestic product—on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1 percent. I think it's seven-tenths of 1 percent. Here's why that matters: We're one of only a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly over the last 25 years. And we've fallen back. The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast. We can't allow this to continue. The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our Federal nondefense research-and-development spending on record. It's going to boost America's innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs: markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular. Critics say we shouldn't spend this money. They ask, ""What do we get out of it?"" Well, they said the same thing when we first flew into space for the first time. They said the same thing. Well, pushing the frontiers led to big benefits back home. When NASA created Apollo's digital flight control system—unheard of at the time—it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes. When NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts, it led to programs that have been used to—for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets. At least 2,000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration. GPS has helped us find each other. Computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another, even when we're separated by mountains and oceans: singing ""Happy Birthday"" and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild; comforting each other when comfort is needed. Think about what it means to you and your loved ones. We just have to imagine again. I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone. And he said—and I was astonished, my national security team and the China experts who were on the line—he said, ""You've always said, Mr. President, that you can define America in one word: possibilities."" That's who we are. In America, anything is possible. Like what we did with vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Like we did when the Interstate Highway System that transformed the way we traveled, lived, worked, and developed. Americans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon. Businesses here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix. To this day, about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year on one of those very original highways. Imagine what we can do, what's within our reach, when we modernize those highways. You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train. We can connect high-speed, affordable, reliable internet wherever you live. Imagine knowing that you're handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology and will need to address one of the biggest threats of our time. That's what we'll do. Altogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs, estimated by some Wall Street outfits, over 18 million jobs over 4 years; good-paying jobs. It also works to level the playing field, empower workers, and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs that you can raise a family on, and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively. That's why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act—the PRO Act—and send it to my desk. This plan is important, not only for what and how it builds, but it's also important to where we build. It includes everyone, regardless of your race or your ZIP Code. Too often, economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast. Too often, investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind. There is talent, innovation everywhere. And this plan connects that talent through cities, small towns, rural communities; through our businesses and our universities; through our entrepreneurs, union workers all across America. We have to move now. Because I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over 8 years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally, create more revenue as well. They are among the highest value investments we can make in the Nation, investing in our infrastructure. But put it another way, failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. That's what crumbling infrastructure does. And our infrastructure is crumbling. We're ranked 13th in the world. What's more, it heightens our vulnerability to—it attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they haven't up to now. And our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure. Put simply, these are investments we have to make. We can afford to make them—or, put another way, we can't afford not to. So how do we pay for it? I spoke to the majority leader and—no longer—I guess he's no longer the majority leader—[laughter]—he has been for a long time. I spoke for the Republican—I spoke to the Republican leader about the plan. Everybody is for doing something on infrastructure. Why haven't we done it? Well, no one wants to pay for it. Less than 4 years ago, as I said, the Congress passed a tax cut of $2 trillion, increasing the national debt $2 trillion. It didn't meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy. Overwhelmingly, the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans. It even included new investments that would profit by shifting profits and jobs overseas if you're a corporation. It was bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle class families, and wrong for our future. So, here's what I'd do. I start with one rule: No one—let me say it again—no one making under $400,000 will see their Federal taxes go up. Period. This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American—in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well. But here's the deal: Right now a middle class couple—a firefighter and a teacher with two kids—making a combined salary of, say, $110-, $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in Federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad—brings it home and then sell it—they pay nothing at all. We're going to raise the corporate tax. It was 35 percent, which is too high. We all agreed, 5 years ago, it should go down to 28 percent, but they reduced it to 21 percent. We're going to raise it back to—up to 28 percent. No one should be able to complain about that. It's still lower than what that rate was between World War II and 2017. Just doing that one thing will generate $1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 years. In 2019, an independent analysis found that are 91—let me say it again, 91 Fortune 500 companies—the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon—they used various loopholes so they'd pay not a single, solitary penny in Federal income tax. I don't want to punish them, but that's just wrong. That's just wrong. A fireman and a teacher paying 22 percent? Amazon and 90 other major corporations are paying zero in Federal taxes? I'm going to put an end to that, and here's how we'll do it. We're establishing a global minimum tax for U.S. corporations of 21 percent. We're going to level the international playing field. That alone will raise $1 trillion over 15 years. We'll also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. You do that, you pay a penalty; you don't get a reward in my plan. And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here—in manufacturing and production here in the United States. And we'll significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their incomes or under-report. It's estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars. All of this adds up to more than what I've proposed to spend in just 15 years. It's honest. It's fiscally responsible. And by the way, as the experts will tell you, it reduces the debt—the Federal debt—over the long haul. But let me be clear: These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan. If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I'm open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. Let me close with this: Historically, infrastructure has been a bipartisan undertaking, many times led by Republicans. It was Abraham Lincoln who built the transcontinental railroad; Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, the Interstate Highway System. I could go on. And I don't think you'll find a Republican today in the House or Senate—maybe I'm wrong, gentlemen—who doesn't think we have to improve our infrastructure. They know China and other countries are eating our lunch. So there's no reason why it can't be bipartisan again. The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future. I'm going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office; listen to them, what they have to say; and be open to other ideas. We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done. I truly believe we're in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice having to be made between democracies and autocracies. You know, there's a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they're going to win is democracies can't reach consensus any longer; autocracies do. That's what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It's a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority? I believe we can. I believe we must. Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was all about. And it's been overwhelmingly popular. When I wrote it, everybody said I had no bipartisan support. We're overwhelming bipartisan support with Republican—registered Republican voters. And ask around. If you live in a town with a Republican mayor, a Republican county executive, or a Republican Governor, ask them how many would rather get rid of the plan. Ask them if it helped them at all. It's what the American Jobs Plan is about, the new one I'm proposing. I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort. I hope and believe a number of businesses will join this effort. And I hope and believe the American people will join this effort: Democrats, Republican, and Independents. We can do this. We have to do this. We will do this. We just have to remember: This is the United States of America. And I've said it a thousand times: There's nothing beyond our capacity if we act together. So it's time to move together. Thank you. And I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed. And the question is: You have to attract even more apprentices, more people, because the—we're building so much. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"Apr 01, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting,"The President. Well, thank you very much. That's a very generous introduction. [Laughter] I hope that's true, but I'm not so sure. Look, folks, first of all, I want to thank you all for this—the faith community leaders getting together. And I want to thank my buddy, Cedric, for honchoing this for me and—because we both believe that you have profound influence on not only your congregations, but on the public at large. You are the community leaders. And Jill and I want to send our warmest wishes to all of you, your families, your congregations, and your communities on this holiday and holy season. You know, what I always find remarkable as one of my avocations is—and I think I drive Cedric crazy and some of you crazy—has been theology and comparative religion. And one of the interesting things—think about the confluence of the—this season marks remarkable confluence of holy days across a number of traditions. Jill and I, we're looking forward to our Easter celebration, where we get to get together with our family. And because we've had the great honor of being vaccinated, we may be able to get together with some of them this Easter. And—but Passover began last week. The Hindu holiday of Holi was last week. Ramadan is right around the corner. And you know it's not only a time of reverence and celebration, it's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations and with your communities. And all of the great confessional faiths have the same notion about the value of human beings and the value in that we're made in the image of God, and that's why all of you gotten involved in the way you have. And no one—no one—no one is not important; everyone is important. And so, you know, everybody is looking to you this season. They—you know, they trust you. It's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations. And I hope that doesn't sound instructive; I don't mean to sound that way. I—you know better than I do. But it's—but to connect with your congregations and those in your community. And so, you know, I think they're looking to you this season. As I said, they trust you. And you have a chance to deliver not only a spiritual direction, but comfort and guidance; prayers of joy, love, reflection; you know, rebirth that's synonymous with these holidays. Because in the last year, you've been through—we've been through an awful lot of tough, tough times, particularly all of you in the faith community. How many times did you watch on a cell phone a parishioner having to say goodbye to his mother or father in a ward where they couldn't be there? A nurse holding up that phone. And all—how many times have you lamented the fact that leaders in your faith community have not even been able to have the funerals that they deserve and the remembrance that is so important, because there's a finality? How many of you have not been able to, you know, be at the cemetery site and with the family? I mean—and there's so many things that people look to you for comfort for. And you know, I said earlier this week, we're in a race against this virus, and the race is far from over. You know, it's—we—it's taken far too many moms and dads; sisters; brothers; you know, grandpops, grandmoms. You know. And they—we put dreams and plans on hold, and it's kept us physically apart, which is not the instinct of human beings. They want to congregate. They want to be with other—and they want to be with one another of like views, like conscience, like values. And so we all know many families are still going without a familiar comfort to the season. We know that, despite the progress we've made, this fight is far from over. We also know that signs of hope have emerged. I was—we were looking at a mass vaccination site out in—I think it was in Arizona, and the nurse was talking to us—virtual. And the nurse was saying that—she said—well, I was asking her how many shots had been given, and she said: ""These are shots of hope. These are shots of hope."" Hope springs eternal. You're a source of so much hope. And more than a—we've now given—I'm very proud to say we've administered over 130 million shots. And 75 percent of all seniors now have received the shots, which is a drastic change and increases exponentially the prospect that they'll live out their lives in the way they anticipated. And you know, 100 million of those shots in fewer than 9 weeks, and more every day. And families are getting the financial relief they need so they can take a breath. I don't know how many of you have had to carry people who have been—in your communities—because they've been—the food shortages—the failure—people getting thrown out of their apartments or not able to pay their mortgage. Well, with the legislation I was able to—[inaudible]—with the help of Cedric and so many other people—get passed, it has brought genuine relief, serious, serious relief to people. It's about, you know, ""What you do unto the least of my brethren, you do unto me."" I mean, it's—this is really—it is significant. And also, you know, we launched a program to—because, you know, this has been an unequal killer. It has focused mainly—you know, the African American community; the Hispanic community; the AAP—the Asian Pacific community. It has—it has damaged them much more than others. They are three to four times more likely to die if they've gotten the COVID. And they're about the same percentage likely to get the COVID over the traditional—the remainder of the white population. And so I've been—we've set up, in our effort to deal with COVID and the COVID team we put together, a scientist who is nothing but racial equity to make sure we can get to the people. And by the way, I need not tell you all I come from a community that has a very large African American population, and I spent a lot of time in the Black church, because it does more for my community than most anything else. And I—I don't know—you know, I can remember discussions way back—when I was a kid getting started in public life—about how there was a distrust for—for some docs and mass vaccination things. And even when we were—I—my wife put together an ability to get mammogram vans to go around communities. There's distrust because, you know, there have been experimentation on African Americans in World War II, so many things where the treatment has not been fair and decent. So I wanted to make—you know, Cedric and I want to make sure that this does not ever happen again. And we've been totally science-based. But you're trusted voices in the community. You know, this is the moment that the people you serve are looking for—for direction, looking for some help. And we need to get the word out. And the word is that these vaccines are safe, I promise you. I promise you they're safe. That's why I've made sure to get one on television so people can see the President of the United States. Why would I take a vaccine that I thought wasn't safe? And they're safe. And—but we also made it more available. One of the things we did—and initially caused a little bit of a stir among some Governors—but you know, we made vaccinations available to 17,000 local pharmacies because that's where people were most comfortable—where they can go. And then, I've scaled that up to now 40,000 local pharmacies and stores you can get these shots. This is going to put vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans. We also have hundreds of mobile vehicles going out in rural and African American and Hispanic communities, because a lot of people that are older, they can't get to where they have to go. And the—and Health and Human Services is making $3 billion in grants available for community groups within States to increase access at our federally run vaccination centers. We partner with faith-based organizations—many of you on the phone, I'm sure—to reverse the vaccine, you know, delay and make sure we can reserve appointments for members. And we're soon going to be in place where everybody—every American will be able to get the vaccine and should get in line. There should be no restrictions based on age any longer because we're able to get over—over—you know, we've gotten millions and millions of shots—vaccines available. So look, the point I guess I'm trying to make is: The faith community—as faith community leaders, you've been critical partners with us in our COVID response and our vaccine efforts already, including many of you on this call. We're enormously grateful for all you've done, including help educate folks about the relief we're delivering through the Rescue Plan; the $1,400; money for childcare; the childcare [child]* tax credit, which is—we're reducing child poverty by 40 percent—are cutting it in half, actually—50 percent. And because of what we've been able to do to provide funding for people who have children—and anyway, it's a long—I don't want—I'm going on too long. But we need you to spread the word. Let people in our communities, in your communities know how important it is to get everyone vaccinated when it's their turn. And soon, they'll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list. And that's how we're going to defeat this virus. And that's how we're going to come together again in our communities, in our houses of worship, in my view. You know, I know people think I'm kidding when I—what I'm worried about now, as the scientists tell me, is that people are getting too cavalier—where, you know, we're traveling a great deal, we're gathering in larger crowds—and people aren't wearing their masks, aren't social distancing, aren't washing their hands. And you see that it's starting to spike in other areas again. So we're not finished with this. So, you know—and I don't, you know—some people think that's an imposition on people's freedom. I think it's the—a godly thing to do. Protect your brother and sister. That's what this is about. It's about protecting people. It's a patriotic duty I think we have. But they're going to listen to your words more than they are me as President of the United States. When they're in your sanctuaries, you can talk to them about what we have to do, what's available, and not to be fearful—not to be fearful getting the vaccine. And I've said, I think it's—I guess I should say, and I'll conclude by saying: I think it's more than a patriotic duty; I think it's a moral duty. Put an end to the dark years behind us—a dark year—and do our part to spread the light in the spirit of all holidays of this spring season. I want to thank you all for what you're doing. I look forward to being able to get back into houses of worship and visit like I have in the past and will hope to do again. But, in the meantime, God bless you all. Thank you for looking out for your—our brethren. And I think we can get this done. But thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"Apr 02, 2021",Remarks on the National Economy and the Federal Coronavirus Response and an Exchange With Reporters,"Well, again, thank you all for coming together to form this historic Cabinet. This is the first in American history that the Cabinet looks like America. That's what we promised we were going to do, and it's—and we've done it. I'm grateful that the Senate acted in a bipartisan way, at a modern record speed, to get the Cabinet confirmed. It's hard to believe, but we are among the quickest formed of all the Cabinet members being put in place. We have a lot to discuss, but while the press is here, I want to make one announcement. Yesterday, in Pittsburgh, I laid out my vision for rebuilding America with the American Jobs program. And while most of the Cabinet will have a role in helping shape and press the Jobs Plan, today I'm announcing that I'm asking five Cabinet members to take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public. Working with my team here in the White House, these Cabinet members will represent me in dealing with Congress, engage the public in selling the plan, and help work out the details as we refine it and move forward. These five members will be Pete Buttigieg, Jennifer Granholm, Marcia Fudge, Marty Walsh, and Gina Raimondo. And I think—I want to thank them in advance for the role they're going to play with this added assignment I'm asking them to take on. And we'll be discussing that today and among other things. And one of those other things—our administration—is a commitment to ""buy American,"" the plan we're putting forward to make sure that when the Government is spending taxpayers' money, that they're spending it on American-made goods of American corporations and American employees. Today I'm directing every member of the Cabinet—I mean this sincerely—every one—to take a hard look at their agency's spending and make sure it follows my ""buy American"" standard, which we set out in January. I'm going to ask you all to report back to me at the next Cabinet meeting. And now we've got a lot of business to do, to get done. And I thank the press for being here, but I'll talk to you all later. Thank you."
"Apr 05, 2021","Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters Upon Arrival From Camp David, Maryland","The President. Before I start, I hope you all have a good weekend. Q. Thank you! Q. You too. The President. I'm looking forward to it. [Laughter] I'm looking forward to it. Well, good morning. This morning we've learned that our economy created 900,000 jobs in March. It means the first 2 months of our administration has seen more new jobs created than the first 2 months in any administration in history. But we still have a long way to go to get our economy back on track after the worst economic and job crisis in nearly a century. But my message to the American people is this: Help is here. Opportunity is coming. And at long last, there's hope for so many families—so many families. Credit for this progress belongs not to me, but to the American people: hard-working women and men who have struggled through this pandemic, never given up, and are determined to get the country back on track, as well as their families. But I think it's also a reflection of two things we're doing here. First, the new economic strategy we've launched: one focused on building from the bottom up and the middle out, and one that puts government on the side of working people—and that rewards work, not wealth. When we invest in the American people, it's not just those at the top that make our economy grow. They're the ones that make it grow: ordinary Americans. We saw the economy gain traction in March as the American Rescue Plan moved and got passed, bringing new hope to our country. And we're going to continue to implement that law in the weeks ahead. By April 7—next week—over 130 million households will have gotten their $1,400 per-person rescue check. Funds are on their way to local communities to put educators, health care workers, home health care aides, police, firefighters, sanitary workers back on the job. They're getting more aid for small businesses, and we're also going to hang an ""open"" sign again on the door to rehire folks that had to be let go. And, in the months ahead, a new childcare tax credit will cut taxes and provide help to millions of families with young children. There is nothing—nothing—I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but I mean it: There's nothing the American people cannot do if we give them a chance. And the American Rescue Plan does precisely that for hard-working, middle class folks at long last. Secondly, today's report also reflects the progress we've made on my other key priority: getting the American people vaccinated. We've turned around a slow-moving vaccination program into being the envy of the world. Yesterday we set an alltime record for Thursday vaccinations, ending a 7-day period—that was the first ever—where we administered 20 million shots in 70 days—in 7 days. That's 20 million shots in a week. No other country has come close to doing that. So we've made significant progress on that front, but the fight is far from over. We know that vaccines are safe and effective. We're vaccinating more people than any other country on Earth. We also have progress on jobs and progress on vaccinations. But in the face of this great news, I need also to make this clear and direct statement to the American people: The progress that we have worked so hard to achieve can be reversed. On the economic front, the benefits and the impacts of the American Rescue Plan are temporary by design. It was a—it is a rescue plan. But as we get the economy back on its feet, we need to do the hard work of building back better for good, for—not just for a while, but for good; not just the short term, but for good. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. It's an 8-year program that invites—and let me put it another way. I've heard from everybody all across the country about the need for infrastructure. How many times have we heard, ""This is infrastructure week"" over the last 4 years? About every second week was infrastructure week, but no infrastructure was built. Well, this is an 8-year program that invests in our roads, our bridges, broadband, airports, ports, and fixing our water systems. It's going to repair our VA hospitals across the country. Many of them are more than 50 years old and are in real need of help. It will invest in research and development to outcompete China and the rest of the world. Independent analysis shows that if we pass this plan, the economy will create 19 million jobs: good jobs, blue-collar jobs, jobs that pay well. That's long-term jobs for pipefitters, health care workers, those who work in the steel factories and the cutting-edge labs as well. The new report out this week shows that nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan can be filled by people who don't have a college degree. Seventy-five percent of those good-paying jobs don't need a associate's degree. It's a blue-collar blueprint for increasing the opportunity for people. This an economic opportunity for those who've helped build the country and have been ignored or neglected for much too long by our Government. It's a once-in-a-generation investment in our economic future—a chance to win the future—paid for by asking big corporations, many of which do not pay any taxes at all, just to begin to pay their fair share. And it won't raise a penny tax on a family making less than $400,000 a year—no Federal tax, no addition. When Congress comes back after this Easter break, I'm going to begin meeting with Democrats, Republicans about this plan. I've spoken to Republicans on the phone. I'm going to be looking forward to meeting with them. They all have their ideas about what it will take, what they like, and what they don't like. That's a good thing. That's the American way. Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable. Changes in my plan are certain. But inaction is not an option. The American people have been promised action on infrastructure for decades. They've been promised that after our leaders would take our country and make it more competitive for decades. I've made my plan to address this long-overdue need. And it's clear: Polls already shows strong support for infrastructure investment for the American people, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or Independents. Congress should debate my plan, change it, and offer alternatives if they think that's what they have to do. But Congress should act. Likewise, on the virus, our program there, too, can be undone. As fast as we're moving, more adults remain to be vaccinated in April, May, and June than have already been vaccinated in February and March. We are not even halfway done yet. Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over. It is not. I've told people that if my administration did the hard work of getting shots to all Americans in the next few months and if the American people continued to do their part—mask up, practice social distancing—we could have a more normal July the 4th. But this is still April, not July. We aren't there yet. And so, cases are going up again. The virus is spreading more rapidly in many places. Deaths are going up in some States. So I ask, I plead with you: Don't give back the progress we've all so—fought so hard to achieve. We need to finish this job. We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch. Wear your mask. Keep safe distance from one another. Wash your hands. Get vaccinated when it's your turn. That's how we're going to beat the virus, cast off the weight of the pandemic that's holding our economy back. While the earliest signs from this job report that's announcing today are promising and the American Rescue Plan is starting to make a real difference, today's report also reminds us how deep a hole we started in. After a year of devastation, there are still 8.4 million fewer jobs today than there were last March—8.4 million. We created 900,000 again. But 8.4 million jobs fewer today than last March. So, too many Americans who have been unemployed for longer than 6 months. Too many women have been forced out of the workforce. Unemployment among people of color remains far too high. Yes, we've made progress by starting to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And yes, the American Rescue Plan is laying the foundation for that economy. But we still need the American Jobs Plan to build on that foundation to build this country back better. So the bottom line is this: Today's report is good news. Today's report shows that the country can—what it can do when we act together to fight a virus, to give working people the help they need. But we still have a long way to go, but I know that we are going to get there and we're going to get there together. May God bless you all. And may you have a happy Easter and a holy Easter. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Employment Rate/National Economy  Q. How much credit are you taking for today's numbers? The President. I'm giving credit to the American people. Q. [Inaudible]—five percent—— Corporate Tax Rate  Q. Is there a risk, sir, if raising taxes could slow the economy? The President. Raising taxes, the studies show, will not slow the economy at all. Asking corporate America just to pay their fair share will not slow the economy at all. It will make the economy function better and will create more energy. The President's Infrastructure Proposal  Q. Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says he's going to fight your administration every step of the way. What is your reaction to that? The President. [Laughter] If the Republicans argue that we don't need infrastructure, it need not—they've been talking about the need for it for years now. If the Republicans decide that we need it, but they're not going to pay for it, it's just going to increase the deficit; if the Republicans say the next phase of my plan—we don't need to invest in VA hospitals and keep the sacred obligation we've made to so many Americans; if the Republicans say that the 400,000 homes and our schools and daycare centers that have lead pipes—lead pipes—delivering water to their doors—if they say we shouldn't be doing that, what do you think would happen if they found out all the lead pipes were up in the Capitol every time they turned on a water fountain? So I think—look, I think we're going to have—I think the Republicans' voters are going to have a lot to say about whether we get a lot of this done. Thank you."
"Apr 05, 2021",Remarks on the Observance of Easter,"The President. I'll be talking a lot about—— Q. Mr. President, how—— The President. Let me say something. We'll be talking about—a lot about infrastructure today. And it's kind of interesting that when the Republicans put forward an infrastructure plan, they thought everything from broadband to dealing with other things would—trains were infrastructure. Now they're saying that there's—only a small portion of what I'm talking about is infrastructure. The fact of the matter is that when you're in a situation where you can't turn on the water fountain in school and worry you're going to drink polluted water that affects your health, replacing all those pipes is infrastructure. When I'm talking about making sure that you take that asbestos out of schools, that's infrastructure. When I'm talking about building high-speed rail, that's infrastructure. When I'm talking about making sure you're in a situation where we can redo some of the Federal buildings that are just absolutely leaking energy every single day, that's infrastructure. And it gets to the roads and bridges and highways and broadband. So I—it's interesting how their definition of infrastructure has changed. But they know it's—they know we need it. Corporate Tax Rates  Q. Are you worried that a higher tax will drive corporations to—— The President. Not at all. Q. ——other countries, though? The President. Not at all. Look, the tax—— Q. Why not? The President. Because there's no evidence of that. The tax was 36 percent. It's now down to 21 percent. And the idea that—that's bizarre. We were talking about a 28-percent tax that everybody thought was just fair enough for everybody. The idea—you have—here you have 51 or 52 corporations of the Fortune 500 haven't paid a single penny in taxes for 3 years. Come on, man. Let's get real. So I'll have a lots to talk about. The President's Infrastructure Proposal  Q. Other than how to pay for the plan, where is the room for negotiation with Republicans? What parts of your plan are you willing to do away with, given the definition of infrastructure here is so different? The President. Well, I'm not going to negotiate with you on that. [Laughter] Q. Well, no, but what would you—— The President. No, but I mean, why would I say that? Q. What would you tell the American people about where you—— The President. Well, I'd tell the American people—— Q. ——you're willing to compromise? The President. ——I'm going to push as hard as I can to change the circumstances so we can compete with the rest of the world—compete with the rest of the world. Everybody around the world is investing billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure, and we're going to do it here. Thank you. Q. And, Mr. President, are you concerned about a fourth wave of the coronavirus? Are you concerned about a fourth surge, Mr. President?"
"Apr 06, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters During a Tour of a Coronavirus Vaccination Site at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia","The President. Good afternoon. Jill and I are—thank you for joining us today. And we're—we have a special guest, as you can see to my left here. And I'm thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites in communities and health care centers all across America. Easter is a day of joy, when we celebrate resurrection and renewal. But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row, most will be apart from their families or friends and a full congregation to fill us with so much joy. But the Scripture tells us, ""Joy cometh in the morning."" As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that longed-for dawn is almost here. We will rebuild our Nation. We will reengage and reimagine what we can be. We'll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And we look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy of the season once again and there'll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing. May God bless you all, may God protect our troops, and take care of the Easter Bunny. [Laughter] Thank you all very, very much. [At this point, the President and First Lady posed for photographs.] All right. Stand in the middle, Easter Bunny. Right here, get in the middle. The First Lady. [Laughter] Come here, Easter Bunny. The President. [Laughter] All right. Nice to see you all. The First Lady. Here you go. Here, Easter Bunny. The President. He can't even see. You've got to squeeze. You've got it, man. All right. Thank you all."
"Apr 06, 2021",Remarks on COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters,"[The President's remarks were joined in progress.] Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts  Q. Mr. President, quickly: Do you think the worst is behind us with COVID-19? The President. I think if everyone continues down the road we're on now, it will be behind us. But it's not over yet. We're in a situation where we—I believe, by the end of this summer, we'll have a significant portion of the American public vaccinated. I'm going to be making a speech when I leave here. There's no place to do it here, but back at the White House, we're going to announce how far down the road we are in terms of the number of people vaccinated with at least one shot. I think before another 25 days, we'll probably have somewhere in excess of 200 million shots that have been administered. And the good news is: A clear, overwhelming majority of people over the age of 65 have gotten at least one shot. And that's the most susceptible age bracket. And the good thing also: All these strains you're hearing about, you should not worry. They are more virulent, and they are—some are more dangerous, but the vaccines work on all of them. So the idea is, don't think that means you shouldn't get a vaccine. That increases the need to get one quickly, because that's how we're going to beat this. And you're going to beat it. But keep wearing a mask. Participant. Yes. The President. Social—wash the hands and socially distance, which I'm not doing. [Laughter] I'm going to get in trouble here. Is this your second shot? Participant. Second shot. The President. Oh, we're set. [Laughter] I've had two as well. So—— Well, thank you. [The tour continued, and no transcript was provided.]"
"Apr 07, 2021",Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, everyone. I just visited a vaccination clinic in Virginia, at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia. The seminary and other houses of worship in the area are partnering with the community health centers to offer vaccination and vaccination sites. They're seeing these kinds of partnerships where—and not just there, but we're seeing them all over the country. People are coming together across the different faiths to serve those most in need, with a special focus on vaccinating seniors from all races, backgrounds, and walks of life. It's an example of America at its finest. And they're all meeting what Pope Francis calls the ""moral obligation"": Get vaccinated—something which can, he went on to say, can save your life and the lives of others. And I was at the seminary clinic to mark an important milestone as well. Yesterday we crossed 150 million shots in 75 days—the first 75 days my administration—on our way to hitting our goal of 200 million shots by the 100th day in office. That, of course, is the new goal I set after passing the original mark of 100 million shots in my first 100 days, doing it in just 58 days. At the time, some said 100 million shots was ""too ambitious,"" and then they said, ""It wasn't ambitious enough."" Well, we've got to keep moving. If we could raise it up higher, I'd do that as well. But we know what we have to do: We have to ramp up a whole-of-Government approach that rallies the whole country and puts us on a war footing to truly beat this virus. And that's what we've been doing: getting enough vaccine supply, mobilizing more vaccinators, creating more places to get vaccinated. And we're now administering an average of 3 million shots per day, over 20 million shots a week. On Saturday alone, we reported, more than 4 million shots were administered. We're the first country to administer 150 million shots and the first country to fully vaccinate over 62 million people. But here's the deal: I promised an update to the American people every 50 millionth shot, and I'm already back to update you a little over 2 weeks, 2½ weeks later. I promised in the beginning that I'd always give you the straight scoop, straight from the shoulder, the good and the bad. Well, here's the truth: The good news is, we're on track to beat our goal of 200 million shots in the first 100 days. More than 75 percent of the people over the age of 65 have gotten shots, up from 8 percent when we took office. That's a dramatic turnaround and critical, because seniors account for 80 percent of all COVID deaths. To help support my goal of safely reopening a majority of K-through-8 schools by my 100th day in office, I directed States in early March to make educators and children—childcare workers eligible for vaccines and to get [set]* a goal of getting all who wanted the vaccination to be able to have one and to do it in the month of March. I'm pleased to report, according to CDC estimates, over 80 percent of teachers, school staff and childcare workers received at least one shot by the end of March. And that's great progress protecting our educators, our essential workers. And because our vaccine program is in overdrive, we're making it easier to get a vaccination shot. Last week, I announced that by April 19 of this month, 90 percent of all Americans will be within five miles of a vaccination site. And further good news is that we're getting more and more data on just how effective the vaccines are. Dr. Fauci recently cited two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine that found fully vaccinated care workers—health care workers on the frontlines had an extremely low infections rate, less than two-tenths of 1 percent, compared to unvaccinated health care workers who had considerably higher infection rates. So we're making incredible progress. There is a lot of good news, but there is also some bad news. New variants of the virus are spreading, and they're moving quickly. Cases are going back up. Hospitalizations are no longer declining. While deaths are still down—way down from January—they're going up in some places. So you might ask—everybody is asking: What does that mean? I understand that people may find it confusing that the vaccination program is saving tens of thousands of lives, but the pandemic remains dangerous. Let me explain it in a single word: Time. Time. Even moving at the record speed we're moving at, we're not even halfway through vaccinating over 300 million Americans. This is going to take time. Remember: For a two-dose vaccine, it takes weeks from the time you get your first one until you are able to get your second shot, which makes you fully protected. If you get your first shot next week, in mid-April, you won't be fully protected until—until May—late May. If you get your first shot in mid-May, you aren't fully protected until late June. So look—now, on the one hand, June isn't that far away given how long this has been going on, but it isn't here yet either. So the virus is spreading because we have too many people who, seeing the end in sight, think we're at the finish line already. But let me be deadly earnest with you: We aren't at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We're still in a life-and-death race against this virus. Until we get more people vaccinated, we need everyone to wash their hands, socially distance, and mask up in a recommended mask from the CDC. Think about it this way: Better times are ahead. And as I've said before, we can have a safe, happy Fourth of July with your family and friends, in small groups in your backyard. The real question is: How much death, disease, and misery are we going to see between now and then? In January—just the month of January—we lost 95,747—excuse me, 95,774 Americans. In March, that was 37,172 Americans. All told—as you're all about to know—I keep doing this, I know, but I carry this card, every day, with my schedule on it. And on the back, I have a COVID update. The total number of deaths in the United States to date is 554,064 dead. That's lives that have been lost. What we do now is going to determine how many people we'll save or lose in the month of April and May and June before we get to July 4. So, please, until we're further along in this accelerating, successful, but still growing vaccination effort, please wash your hands. Practice social distancing. Wear a mask, as recommended by the CDC. Get vaccinated when it's your turn. While I'm asking Americans—the American people to do their job, here's what I'm doing. When we first started our vaccination program, the real question is how quickly we could get shots in people's arms. Well, by the end of May, the vast majority of adult Americans will have gotten at least their first shot. That success—that success—is going to save lives and get this country back to normal sooner. But it's not enough. On March the 11th, I announced that I was opening up all vaccination sites to all adults by May 1. Many Governors—Democrats and Republicans—responded and decided to beat that date, which was good. Thanks to their hard work and the hard work of the American people, and the hard work of my team, I'm announcing today that we're moving that date up from May 1 to April 19, nationwide. That means, by no later than April 19, in every part of this country, every adult over the age of 18—18 or older will be eligible to be vaccinated. No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions. My message today is a simple one. Many States have already opened up to all adults. But beginning April 19, every adult in every State, every adult in this country is eligible to get in line to get a COVID vaccination. And today, in advance of that new national full-eligibility date, I want to make a direct appeal to our seniors and everyone who cares about them. While we have made incredible progress vaccinating three-quarters of our seniors and putting vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of the public, it still isn't enough. It's simple: Seniors, it's time for you to get vaccinated now. Get vaccinated now. To make it easier, my administration is sending aid to community groups to drive seniors to vaccination sites. We're incredibly grateful to all the volunteers, houses of worship, and the civic groups that are helping us in this effort. This is America. We take care of one another. And we have to keep it up. As I ask seniors to sign up for their shots now, I also have a message for people under 65. If you know someone over 65 who has not gotten this lifesaving vaccine, call them now. Work with them to get their shots this week or next. Pick them up, drive them. It can be your parents, your grandparents, your aunt, uncle, your neighbors. And finally, even after we open up vaccinations to all adults and put a site within 5 miles of 90 percent of the public, we know there are many people who still struggle to get access to a shot. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities and people in many communities of color who may be isolated and lack access to transportation. That's why we're ramping up transportation to vaccination centers and deploying more mobile units and pop-up clinics in the places close to where people live. That's why we're working with faith-based organizations and other community groups to host vaccination clinics, sign people up for appointments, get help—help them get those appointments. That's why we're sending even more vaccines to community health centers, like the one I was in today, that all together serve nearly 30 million Americans, like the ones I visited today. Two-thirds of the patients at community health centers live at or below the poverty level. Sixty percent are racial and ethnic minorities. To reach them, we're investing nearly $10 billion to expand testing, treatment, and vaccinations for the hardest hit yet most underserved communities. Let me close with this: We've vaccinated more people than any other nation on Earth. The vaccines have proven to be safe and effective. That should give us real hope, but it can't let it—we can't let it make us complacent. Despite the progress we're making as a nation, I want every American to know in no uncertain terms that this fight isn't over. This progress we've worked so hard to achieve can be reversed. Now is not the time to let down. Now is not the time to celebrate. It's time to do what we do best as a country: do our duty, our jobs, taking care of one another. And we can and will do this, but we can't let up now. My hope is, before the summer is over, I'm talking to you all about how we have even access to more vaccines than we need to take care of every American, and we're helping other poor countries, countries around the world that don't have the money, the time, the expertise. Because until this vaccine is available to the world and we're beating back the vaccine—the virus in other countries, we're not really completely safe. So we've made great progress. I'm still looking forward to the prospect if we keep the pace we're on and we listen to one another and take the precautions I talked about, that you'll be able to have a Fourth of July, an Independence Day on July the 4th, as I defined about 3 weeks ago. I want to have an Independence Day, an independence from the COVID, so you're able to get in the backyard with a small group of people, of friends and neighbors, and celebrate Independence Day because you've been vaccinated, because you're safe, because you're in the clear. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much for listening. Thank you. Iran Nuclear Negotiations in Vienna, Austria  Q. Mr. President—how are the talks going, Mr. President? In Vienna, how are the Vienna talks going? The President. I'll report on that later. 2021 Master's Golf Tournament in Augusta, Georgia/Georgia Election Legislation  Q. Mr. President, do you think the Masters golf tournament should be moved out of Georgia? The President. I think that's up to the Masters. Look, you know, it is reassuring to see that for-profit operations and businesses are speaking up about how these new Jim Crow laws are just antithetical to who we are. There's another side to it too. The other side to it too is, when they, in fact, move out of Georgia, the people who need the help the most—people who are making hourly wages—sometimes get hurt the most. I think it's a very tough decision for a corporation to make or a group to make, but I respect them when they make that judgment, and I support whatever judgment they make. But it's—the best way to deal with this is for Georgia and other States to smarten up. Stop it. Stop it. It's about getting people to vote. Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Coronavirus Vaccination Efforts/Vaccine Hesitancy  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Despite your personal appeal now, there are many Americans who are very reluctant to take the vaccine, especially in red States. Why the White House hasn't used a more forceful campaign, like advertisement on television, for example, to convince Americans to take that vaccine so we can reach the herd immunity? The President. We are. We are doing that. And by the way, the number of people who are reluctant to take it continues to diminish. It continues to diminish across the country as they see their neighbors, particularly in communities that have been very—now, there's a different group of people. There's a group of people who've been reluctant because of past—how can I say it?—past wrongs that had been done to them, experimentation, not sure that they're being told the truth, et cetera. But then, there's another group that seems, to me, to be—I probably shouldn't characterize it, but Mitch McConnell keeps speaking to them, which I give him credit for, saying, ""The idea""—he said the polling data shows Republican men, particularly young men, don't think they should have to take the vaccine; it's their patriotic right not to do it, their freedom to choose. And he's saying: ""No, no, take the vaccine. Take the vaccine."" And I'll add a phrase he didn't, but I think he believes: It's a patriotic responsibility you have. Last question. Q. Mr. President—— Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell  Q. Mr. President, have you spoken to the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jay Powell, yet? The President. I have not. Q. Can you say why? Do you plan to speak to him soon, sir? The President. I am not—look, I think the Federal Reserve is an independent operation. And starting off my Presidency, I want to be real clear that I'm not going to do the kinds of things that had been done in the last administration, either talking to the Attorney General about who he's going to prosecute or not prosecute and under what circumstances or the Fed, telling them what they should and shouldn't do, even though that wouldn't be the basis upon which I'd be talking to him. So I've been very fastidious about not talking to them, but I do talk to the Secretary of Treasury. Thank you all very much. Coronavirus Pandemic  Q. And one more on COVID, Mr. President. You mentioned 554,064 American dead from COVID-19. A lot of families want to know how this happened, how it got here. Have you had a chance to speak to any of your international partners, any of—President Xi, who I know you go way back with? Have you had the chance to ask him if these reports are true, that China maybe misled the world at the beginning? The President. No, I have not had that conversation with President Xi. Thank you."
"Apr 08, 2021",Remarks on Gun Violence Prevention Efforts,"The President. Good afternoon, everyone. Last week in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I announced my plan to rebuild what I refer to as the ""backbone of America"" through the American Jobs Plan. It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges; it's a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we've done since we built the Interstate Highway System and won the Space Race decades ago. It's the single largest investment in American jobs since World War II, and it's a plan that puts millions of Americans to work to fix what's broken in our country: tens of thousands of miles of roads and highways, thousands of bridges in desperate need of repair. But it also is a blueprint for infrastructure needed for tomorrow—not just yesterday, tomorrow—for American jobs, for American competitiveness. Last week, I said that once Congress is back from recess, I'd get to work right away because we have no time to lose. So here we are. Democrats and Republicans will have ideas about what they like and what they don't like about our plan. That's a good thing. That's the American way. That's the way democracy works. Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable. Changes are certain. In the next few weeks, the Vice President and I will be meeting with Republicans and Democrats to hear from everyone. And we'll be listening. We'll be open to good ideas and good-faith negotiations. But here's what we won't be open to: We will not be open to doing nothing. Inaction simply is not an option. Now, since I announced this plan, I've heard from my Republican friends say that it's—many of them say it's too big. They say, ""Why not focus on traditional infrastructure, fix what we've already got—the roads and the highways that exist and the bridges?"" I'm happy to have that debate. But I'm going to tell you my view. We are America. We don't just fix for today, we build for tomorrow. Two hundred years ago, trains weren't ""traditional"" infrastructure either until America made a choice to lay down tracks across the country. Highways weren't ""traditional"" infrastructure until we allowed ourselves to imagine that roads could connect our Nation across State lines. The idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the American people and their needs, and it's evolving again today. We need to start seeing infrastructures through its effect on the lives of working people in America. What is the foundation today that they need to carve out their place in the middle class to make it: to live, to go to work, to raise their families with dignity, to ensure that good jobs will be there for their kids, no matter who they are or what ZIP Code they live in? That's what infrastructure means in the 21st century. It still depends on roads and bridges, ports and airports, rail and mass transit, but it also depends on having reliable, high-speed internet in every home. Because today's high-speed internet is infrastructure. It depends on the electric grid, a grid that won't collapse in a winter storm or be compromised by hackers at home or abroad. It depends on investing in ""Made in America"" goods from every American community, including those that have historically been left out: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Americans, rural communities. Talk to folks around the country about what really makes up the foundation of a good economy. Ask a teacher or a childcare worker if having clean drinking water—noncontaminated drinking water—in our schools, in our childcare centers is part of that foundation, when we know that the lead in our pipes slows a child's development when they drink that water. Ask the entrepreneur whose small business was destroyed by the second hundred-year flood in the last 10 years in Iowa or wildfires in the West that burned 5 million acres last year, an area roughly the size of the entire State of New Jersey. More fires than ever. Or the devastating damage—seeing more frequent and more intense hurricanes and storms on the East and Gulf Coasts. Ask all those farmers and small-business owners and homeowners whether investing in clean energy to fight the effects of climate change is part of infrastructure. Ask folks in rural America, where more than 35 percent of the people lack a reliable, high-speed internet, limiting their ability to conduct business or engage in remote learning for their schools. Ask them whether investing in internet access will lead to better jobs in town, new markets for farmers, and better opportunities for their kids. And I'm serious about this. Ask the moms and dads in the ""sandwich generation""—the folks carrying enormous personal and financial strains trying to raise their children and care for their parents—their elderly parents—or members of their families with a disability. Ask them what sort of infrastructure they need to build a little better life, to be able to breathe a little bit. It's expanded services for seniors. It's homecare workers, who go in and cook their meal, help them get around and live independently in their home, allowing them to stay in their homes, and I might add, saving Medicaid hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. It's better wages and benefits and opportunities for caregivers, who are disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants. Or ask our wounded warriors and military families. To my Republican colleagues in Congress, shouldn't we modernize VA hospitals, update them? Many of them are more than 50 years old. How about the estimated 450,000 post-9/11 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, who, when they make that emergency call—or their husband, wife, son, daughter makes that call to the VA hospital—""Dad needs help, we have to bring him in."" And they hear: ""You have to wait. We don't have room now. Come back. Call me back in 8 days, 10 days, 12 days."" Look at the—more suicides in the military than people getting shot. Is it really your position, my friends, that our veterans don't deserve the most modern facilities? We could catch that cancer diagnosis quicker, with access to better roads, cleaner water, high-speed internet that delivers information faster and more of it. Above all, infrastructure is about meeting the needs of a nation and putting Americans to work and being able to do and get paid for doing—having good jobs. Plumbers and pipefitters replacing those, literally, thousands of miles of dangerous lead pipes. They're still out there. Everybody remembers what happened in Flint. There's hundreds of Flints all across America. How many of you know, when you send your child to school, the fountain they're drinking out of is not fed by a lead pipe? How many of you know the school your child is in still has asbestos in the walls and lacks the ventilation? Is that not infrastructure? Line workers and electricians laying transmission lines for a modern grid, providing over 500,000 charging stations on the highways we are going to build to accommodate electric vehicles so we can own the future. Construction workers and engineers building modern hospitals and homes for American families. Health care workers, steelworkers, folks who work in the cutting-edge labs. Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created by our American Jobs Plan can be filled by people who don't have a college degree. Seventy-five percent don't need an associate's degree. Now, as I said last week, this is a blue-collar blueprint for increasing opportunity for the American people. It also includes the biggest investment in nondefense research and development on record. I promise you—this is not part of my speech—but I promise you, you're all going to be reporting over the next 6 to 8 months how China and the rest of the world is racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future, attempting to own the future. The technology, quantum computing, investing significant amounts of money in dealing with cancer and Alzheimer's—that's the infrastructure of a nation. There's a new book out about how we've fallen behind. America is no longer the leader of the world because we're not investing. It used to be we invested almost 2.7 percent of our GDP in infrastructure. Now it's about 0.7 percent. When we were investing in it, we were the leader in the world. I don't know why we don't get this. One of the only—a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development has declined as a percentage of GDP in the last 25 years—declined: the United States of America—that led the world. Why does this matter? Investing in research and development help lead to lithium batteries, LED technology, the internet itself. It helped lead to vaccine breakthroughs that are helping us beat COVID-19; to the Human Genome Project, which has led to breakthroughs in how we understand and fight cancer and other diseases. Government—meaning, the taxpayers—funded this research. Government. When we stop investing in research, we stop investing in the jobs of the future, and we give up leading the world. And when we do invest in research, what we're really doing is raising the bar on what we can imagine. Imagine a world where you and your family can travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas, or in a high-speed train, close to as fast as you can go across the country in a plane. Imagine your children growing up to work in innovation, good-paying jobs in fields that haven't even been invented yet, like the parents of every computer programmer, every graphic designer, every renewable energy worker once did—imagined. We invest today so that these jobs will be here in America tomorrow, so America can lead the world that is—as it's historically done. That's why I brought back scientists into the White House. We need to think. Look, do we think the rest of world is waiting around? ""We're not going to make those kinds of investments,"" the rest of the world is saying. Take a look. Do you think China is waiting around to invest in its digital infrastructure or in research and development? I promise you, they are not waiting, but they're counting on American democracy to be too slow, too limited, and too divided to keep pace. You've heard me say it before: I think this generation is going to be marked by the competition between democracies and autocracies, because the world is changing so rapidly. The autocrats are betting on democracy not being able to generate the kind of unity needed to make decisions to get in that race. We can't afford to prove them right. We have to show the world—and much more importantly, we have to show ourselves—that democracy works; that we can come together on the big things. This is the United States of America for God's sake. Of course, building the infrastructure of tomorrow requires major investments today. As I said last week, I'm open to ideas about how to pay for this plan, with one exception: I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. If others have ideas out there on how to pay for this investment without violating that rule, they should come forward. There's all kinds of opportunities. Just list all the tax breaks that I find difficult to explain: wealthy deductions, $360 billion if you cap them; top rate of 39 percent, which it used to be for a hundred—for years, all the way to the Bush administration; almost a quarter of a trillion dollars, corporate minimum tax; and the fossil fuel giveaways at $40 billion, et cetera. I could go on. But let me tell you what I proposed, how to do it. We're going to raise the corporate tax rate. It was 35 percent for the longest time, which was too high. Barack and I thought it was too high during our administration. We all agreed 5 years ago that it should come down somewhat, but the previous administration reduced it all the way down to 21 percent. What I'm proposing is that we meet in the middle: 28 percent. Twenty-eight percent—we'll still have lower corporate rates than any time between World War II and 2017. It will generate over a trillion dollars in taxes over 15 years. A new, independent study put out last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations lose the very—use the various loopholes to pay zero Federal tax—income tax—in 2020. It's just not fair. It's not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers. We're going to try to put an end to this. Not fleece them—28 percent. If you're a mom, a dad, a cop, firefighter, police officer, et cetera, you're paying close to that in your income tax. I've also proposed a global minimum tax, which is being proposed around the world for U.S. corporations, of 21 percent. Let me tell you that means. It means that companies aren't going to be able to hide their income in places like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, in tax havens. We're going to also eliminate deductions used by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. They offshore the jobs, shift the assets overseas, and then don't have to pay taxes on all they make there. And we'll significantly ramp up IRS enforcement against corporations and the super wealthy who either failed to report their income or underreport it. It's estimated that would raise tens of billions of dollars. It adds up to more than what I proposed in just 15 years. It's honest. It's fair. It's fiscally responsible. And it pays for what we need and reduces the debt over the long haul. And by the way, I didn't hear any of our friends, who are criticizing this plan, say that the corporate tax cut, which added $2 trillion to the debt—the Trump tax cut, $2 trillion, $1.9 trillion in debt—wasn't paid for, the vast majority of which went to the top 1 percent of the wage earners. I didn't hear anybody hollering in this recovery—the so-called—before I became President—this ""K-shaped"" recovery, where billionaires made $300 billion more dollars during this period. Where's the outrage there? I'm not trying to punish anybody. But damn it, maybe it's because I come from a middle class neighborhood, I'm sick and tired of ordinary people being fleeced. Let me close by saying this: Whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues, there don't have to be around this one. The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future. These aren't Republican bridges, Democratic airports, Republican hospitals, or a Democratic power grid. Think of the transcontinental railroad, Interstate Highway System, or the space race. We're one Nation, united and connected. As I said last week, I'm going to bring Republicans to the White House. I invite them to come. We'll have good-faith negotiations. And any Republican who wants to get this done, I invite. I invite them. We have to get this—things done. We're at an inflection point in American democracy. This is a moment where we prove whether or not democracy can deliver. Whether it can lay the foundation for an economy built from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle-down economics from the very top. Whether it can lay a good foundation for good jobs in a 21st-century economy. I tell the kids—the young people who work for me and told my kids—when I go on college campuses, they're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we've seen in the last 50 years. We're going to talk about commercial aircraft flying at subsonic speeds—supersonic speeds. Be able to, figuratively, if you may—if we decided to do it, traverse the world in about an hour, travel 21,000 miles an hour. So much is changing. We have got to lead it. I believe democracy can come through when the American people come together. We saw it in the American Rescue Plan. We're seeing it with the Jobs Plan. And the American Rescue Plan, which got so badly criticized—how many of my Republican colleagues have you seen gone on your stations or your newspapers and say, ""Boy, people in my State really like it""? Because it would be improper having asked permission. The number of Republicans and Democrats who were hesitant and have called me saying, ""God, this really works."" Overwhelming majority of the American people—Democrats, Republics, and Independents—support infrastructure investments that meets the moment. So I urge the Congress: Listen to your constituents, and together, we can lay a foundation for an economy that works for everyone and allows America to remain the world leader. When we do that, I believe, as I said last week, that in 50 years from now, when people look back, they'll say this was the moment, together, that we won America's future. I really believe that. Thank you all. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Corporate Tax Rates  Q. Mr. President, are you willing to go lower than the 28-percent corporate tax rate? The President. I'm willing to listen to that. I'm willing to—I'm wide open to, but we've got to pay for this. We've got to pay. There's many other ways we can do it, but I'm willing to negotiate that. I've come forward with the best, most rational way—in my view, the fairest way—to pay for it. But there are many other ways as well, and I'm open. Bipartisanship/American Rescue Plan Act of 2021  Q. Will you have failed on your promise of bipartisanship if you don't get Republicans on board with this plan? Your first plan passed along party lines. The President. Look, what I said was, I would try to work with my friends on the other side. There are things we're working on together, some of which we've passed and some we will pass. But the last plan I laid out what was available, what I was suggesting, and how I'd deal with it. And a bipartisan group came to see me. And then, a Republican group came to see me. And they started off at $600 billion, and that was it. If they come forward with a plan that did the bulk of it and it was a billion-three or -four, -two or -three, that allowed me to have pieces of all that was in there, I would have been—I would've been prepared to compromise, but they didn't. They didn't move an inch. Not an inch. But, for example, I am dealing with a bipartisan group that came to see me. Now it's about—what?—3, 4 weeks ago when they came about computer chips and about—and they said: ""Look, we have to have our own supply. We have to work together."" We're working on that.Chuck Schumer and, I think, McConnell are about to introduce a bill along those lines. So I'm prepared to work. I really am. But to automatically say that the only thing that's infrastructure is a highway, a bridge, or whatever, that's just not rational. It really isn't. I think the vast majority of Americans think everything from the sewer pipes to the sewer facilities, to the water pipes—I think they're infrastructure. Anyway. Thank you all so very much. Q. Mr. President, on guns? Q. [Inaudible]—Abdullah? Mr. President, can you talk about Jordan, sir? Gun Violence  Q. What are you going to do on guns, Mr. President? The President. I'll be talking to you about that, I think, the day after tomorrow. Q. Ghost guns? The President. Thank you. King Abdullah II of Jordan  Q. Can you tell us what you told the King of Jordan, Mr. President? Are you concerned about the situation there? The President. No, I'm not. I just called to tell him that he has a friend in America. Stay strong."
"Apr 09, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Economic Advisers,"Thank you, Kamala—Madam Vice President. Thank you very much. You know, we're joined today by the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who I've asked to prioritize gun violence. It's also good to see the Second Gentleman, who is here. And it's good to see the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well. And I look out there and I see so many Members of Congress who have led in this fight. So many of you who have never given up. So many of you who are in—absolutely determined, as Murphy and others are, to get this done. We've got a long way to go. It always seems like we always have a long way to go. But I also—today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis. Nothing—nothing—I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment. They're phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we're talking about. But no amendment—no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can't yell crowd—you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech. From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we're recommending are contrary to the Constitution. Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. Let me say it again: Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. And it's an international embarrassment. You know, we saw that again. Last night, as I was coming to the Oval office, I got the word that, in South Carolina, a physician with his wife, two grandchildren, and a person working at his house was gunned down—all five. So many people—so many of the people sitting here today—know that well, unfortunately. You know, they know what it's like when the seconds change your life forever. I have had the pleasure of getting to meet, in awful circumstances, many of you who have lost your children, your husbands, your wives. You know, they know what it's like to bury a piece of their soul deep in the Earth. We understand that. Mark and Jackie, I want to tell you: It's always good to see you, but not under these circumstances. I want to say, before I introduce the rest of the folks, is, you know, what—a lot of people have not been through what they've been through—don't understand. It takes a lot of courage to come to an event like this. They're absolutely, absolutely determined to make change. But Mark and Jackie, whose son Daniel was a first grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School are—Daniel loved sports—loves outdoors sports, getting muddy. I see my friend Fred Guttenberg. His daughter Jaime was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She was an accomplished dancer. I see Brandon Wolf, who—the shooting at the—at the impulse—at the Pulse club—nightclub. He survived, but his two best friends died. Greg Jackson, who was just walking down the street when he was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight. And of course, I see a close friend of Jill's and mine, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who is here. Who was speaking with her constituents in front a grocery store in her State when she was shot and a member of her staff was killed. You know, they're here, and their pain is immense. And you know, what a lot of you—hopefully, many of you don't know is if you've gone through a trauma, no matter how much you work to make sure others don't go through it, every time you show up at an event like this, it brings back when you got that phone call. It brings back the immediacy of what happened at that moment. So I genuinely mean it: Thank you. Thank you for having the courage: the courage to be here, the courage to continue this fight. Senator Blumenthal understands it. A lot of the folks out here understand it. But it takes real courage, so thank you. To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the actions that gives meaning to the word ""enough."" Enough. Enough. Enough. Because what they want you to know, what they want you to do is not just listen. Every day in this country, 316 people are shot. Every single day. A hundred and six of them die every day. Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder of 8 primarily Asian American people in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in Colorado. You probably didn't hear it, but between those two incidents, less than 1 week apart, there were more than 850 additional shootings—850—that took the lives of more than 250 people and left 500—500—injured. This is an epidemic, for God's sake. And it has to stop. So I'm here to talk about two things: First, the steps we're going to take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence. I asked the Attorney General and his team to identify for me immediate, concrete actions I could can take now without having to go through the Congress. And today I'm announcing several initial steps my administration is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence. Much more need be done, but the first—first, I want to rein in the proliferation of so-called ""ghost guns."" These are guns that are homemade, built from a kit that include directions on how to finish the firearm. You can go buy the kit. They have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. And the buyers aren't required to pass a background check to buy the kit to make the gun. Consequently, anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a weapon. You know, I want to see these kits treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act, which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers and run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that package. The section action we're—the second action we're going to take—back in 2000—the year 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms released a report on its investigations into firearms trafficking in America. The report was of pivotal value. It was an important tool for policymakers when I was in the Senate and beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted into dangerous hands. Today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed, and we have to adjust. We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report. This report will better help policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it was yesterday. The third change: We want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the seriousness they deserve. A stabilizing brace—you're going to pistol—essentially, it makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate and a minirifle. As a result, it's more lethal, effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle. That's what the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have done. I want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act. The National Firearms Act requires that a potential owner pay a $200 fee and submit their name and other identifying information to the Justice Department, just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun. Fourthly, during my campaign for President, I wanted to make it easier for States to adopt extreme-risk protection order laws. They're also called ""red flag"" laws, which everybody in this lawn knows, but many people listening do not know. These laws allow a police or family member to petition a court in their jurisdiction and say: ""I want you to temporarily remove from the following people any firearm they may possess because they're a danger and a crisis. They're presenting a danger to themselves and to others."" And the court makes a ruling. To put this in perspective, more than half of all suicides, for example, involve the use of a firearm. But when a gun is not available, an attempt at suicide, the death rate drops precipitously. States that have ""red flag"" laws have seen and—seen a reduction in the number of suicides in their States. Every single month, by the way, an average of 53 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. It's been a constant struggle to keep it moving. We know ""red flag"" laws can have a significant effect in protecting women from domestic violence. And we know ""red flag"" laws can stop mass shooters before they can act out their violent plans. I'm proud—""Excuse the point of personal privilege,"" we used to say in the Senate—I'm proud that the red flag law in my home State of Delaware was named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden—our son; excuse me, Jill—who proposed that legislation back in 2013. I want to see a national ""red flag"" law and legislation to incentivize States to enact their own ""red flag"" laws. Today I asked the Justice Department to publish a model ""red flag"" legislation so States can start crafting their own laws right now. Just like with background checks, the vast majority of Americans support these extreme-risk protection order laws, and it's time to put these laws on the books and protect even more people. The Attorney General will have more to say about this in a moment. Additionally, we recognize that cities across the country are experiencing historic spikes in homicides, as the law enforcement can tell you. The violence is hitting Black and Brown communities the hardest. Homicide is the leading cause of death of Black boys and men ages 15 to 34—the leading cause of death. But there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities. But many of these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late. Gun violence in America—for those of you who think of this from an economic standpoint listening to me—estimated to cost the Nation $280 billion—let me say it again—$280 billion a year. They said, ""How could that be, Joe?"" Hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity. Not to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to. This gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our children, even if they're never involved in pulling the trigger or being the victim of—on the other side of a trigger. For a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of us and save billions of American dollars in the meantime, much of it, as Senator Cicilline knows, is taxpayer money. Finally, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the key agency enforcing gun laws, hasn't had a permanent Director since 2015. Today I'm proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as the Director of the AFT. David knows the AFT well. He served there for 25 years. And Vice President Harris and I believe he's the right person, at this moment, for this important agency. And I've said before: My job, the job of any President, is to protect the American people. Whether Congress acts or not, I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal as President to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there's much more that Congress can do to help that effort. And they can do it right now. They've offered plenty of thoughts and prayers—Members of Congress—but they've passed not a single new Federal law to reduce gun violence. Enough prayers. Time for some action. I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases—purchasers to bypass the background checks. The vast majority of the American people, including gun owners, believe there should be background checks before you purchase a gun. As was noted earlier, hundreds of thousands of people have been denied guns because of the background checks. What more would have happened? These bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show or an online sale. Most people don't know: If you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check. Second thing is to close the Charleston—what's known as the ""Charleston"" loophole. Like people here, I spent time down at that church in Charleston. What happened is, someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service. If the FBI hasn't completed—didn't complete the background check within 3 days. There's a process. If wasn't done in 3 days, according to Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun. They bought the gun and killed a hell of a lot of innocent people who invited him to pray with them. And three, reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which would—the so-called—close the ""boyfriend"" and ""stalking"" loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of people found by a court to be an abuser and continuing threat. I held over a thousand hours of hearings to pass the Violence Against Women Act, and one thing came through. If in fact a stay-away order—an order preventing the abuser from coming in a certain distance of the person he has abused or she has abused—and now the idea that they can own a weapon when they have a court order saying they are an abuser? These are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives. But all these bills, they had support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House. And universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of the American people and, I might add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners. So let me be clear: This is not a partisan issue among the American people. This is a view by the American people as an American issue. And I'm willing to work with anyone to get these done. And it's long past time that we act. Now, I know this has been a hobbyhorse of mine for a long time—got it done once. We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. For that 10 years we had it done, the number of mass shootings actually went down. Even law enforcement officials have told me, and told other champions of this legislation, they sometimes feel outgunned by assault weapons with large-capacity magazines. There's no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets that can be fired from that weapon. Nobody needs that. Nobody needs that. We got that done when I was a United States Senator. It wasn't easy going up against the gun lobby, but it saved lives. And we should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they received from the Congress. You realize—again, the people here because they're so knowledgeable out here in the Rose Garden. But one piece that people don't realize: The only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry that can't be sued—has exempt from being sued are gun manufacturers. Imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available to tobacco companies who knew and lied about the danger they were causing: the cancer caused and the like. Imagine where we'd be. But this is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued. If I get one thing on my list—the Lord came down and said, ""Joe, you get one of these""—give me that one. Because I tell you what, there would be a ""come to the Lord"" moment these folks would have real quickly. But they're not. They're not. They're exempt. I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there's much more common ground than we—anyone would believe. There's much more common ground. Everything that's being proposed today is totally consistent with the Second Amendment. And there's a wide consensus behind the need to take action. I know that when overwhelming majorities of Americans want to see something change that will affect their lives and it still doesn't change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens. It can feel like our entire political process is broken. I know it's painful and frustrating that we haven't made the progress that we'd hoped for. But it took 5 years to get Brady bill passed, and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons ban. And it saved lives. No matter how long it takes, we're going to get these passed. We're not going to give up. We have an opportunity to fulfill the first responsibility of Government: to keep our people safe. And in the process, we can show the world and show ourselves that democracy works, that we can come together and get big things done. When I look around and see such brave survivors sitting out here in the Rose Garden, public servants who devoted their lives to dealing with this, advocates who feel strongly and are pushing every day to make the rational changes, and courageous parents and family members, I know that progress, even in this most difficult of issues, is possible. So, folks, this is just the start. We've got a lot of work to do. But I know almost every one of you sitting in the garden here; none of you have ever given up. We're not going to give up now. The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as nation. Let me say to all of you: God bless you, but most importantly, the memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence. And now I'd like to hand it over to the Attorney General for him to speak and make some comments. And I hope I get a chance to see some of you after this is over. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"Apr 12, 2021",Remarks at a Virtual CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience and an Exchange With Reporters,"Death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, of the United Kingdom  Well, first of all, Jill and I, and the entire administration, send our condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the loss of Prince Philip. He was a heck of a guy. He—you know, he was—in his lifetime of service to the United Kingdom and the whole Commonwealth was visible to everybody for a long, long time, and his bravery serving in World War II, as well as his being a champion of the environment, as well as the charity—the charitable things he set up. So we really do express our condolences for an extraordinary life that was led by the Prince. And it—I think he's going to be missed, particularly in the United Kingdom. Ninety-nine years old, and he never slowed down at all, and—which I admire the devil out of. Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Guidance  And today we're meeting on—we're having an economic briefing here with the team. I sent to Congress my funding priorities for the appropriations process, including two key public health initiatives that I'm pushing. The first is—like DARPA in the Defense Department, which was designed to develop, and has developed, breakthroughs to protect us and enhance our physical safety—I'm proposing a $6.5 billion appropriation for what we call ""ARPA-H,"" which is focused on going to—focused on health issues. This is a pioneering breakthrough that we hope we can detect and treat and prevent diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes and give us a chance to end cancer as we know it, because we'll focus exclusively on those items. And secondly, I'm proposing a historic funding increase of 50 percent up to—of $4 billion to end the opioid crisis, which still ravages the country and has taken so many lives over the last 2 years; resources both to the States and to Tribes for treatment, as well as prevention. That also includes the single largest funding increase ever for title I schools—for disadvantaged schools—to lift up the millions of children in low-income families. And it will put them in a position where all the data is—we've—I've talked a lot about this—the data shows that it puts a child from a household that is a lower income household in a position, if they start school—not daycare, but school—at 3 and 4 years old, there's overwhelming evidence that they are able to compete all the way through high school and beyond. And so it doubles the funding as well for VAWA services, including resources to end the rape-kit backlog. We've been working on this for a long, long time, and we still have a backlog on the rape kit. And the point is: A significant number of women who have been raped—and the person has not been found or convicted is because they're sitting in jail. The average rapist rapes about six times. And so, out there, we're—we want to make sure we go through this backlog and find out, to bring some certitude to—for the woman who is saying: ""No, no, it was true. That's the man. He did it."" And it changes the whole perspective—all the hearings we held on that. And also there—it makes major investments in the fight against climate change. And there's issues that are personal to millions of Americans in the area of VAWA, because I get that asked, and we get spoken to by everyone from mayors and Governors, local officials of both parties. So I look forward to working with Congress to advance these and other priorities. I think we're going to be able to get—I'm hoping we will have some bipartisan support across the board. I've already spoken to some of my Republican colleagues about dealing with the infrastructure legislation we have up there, as well as other budget items. So we're going to work on seeing if we can get some bipartisan support across the board here. But that's what we're about to do now. We're going to talk about our economic priorities, and we'll get the brief from the team here. But thank you all for coming."
"Apr 12, 2021",Remarks Prior to Meeting With Members of Congress on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Well, look, the reason I'm here today is—all of these technology manufacturing leaders around the country and all over the world on the screen—is to talk about how we strengthen our domestic semiconductor industry and secure America's supply chain. This is an issue that has broad support in United States Congress. We've talked about whether or not we're doing anything in terms of bipartisanly. Well, we are. Both sides of the aisle are strongly supportive of what we're proposing, and I—and where I think we can really get things done for the American people. In fact, today I received a letter from 23 Senators—bipartisanly—and 42 House Members—Republican and Democrats—supporting the CHIPS for America program. Now, let me quote from the letter. It says, ""the Chinese Communist Party has—aggressively plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain . . ."" And it goes into how much money they're pouring in to being able to be able to do that. But I've just—I've been saying for some time now: China and the rest of the world is not waiting, and there's no reason why Americans should wait. We're investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries. That's what they're doing and others; so must we. We are seeking a significant investment in the—in this piece of legislation. And it's important, but we know it's not sufficient. The American Jobs Plan that I've put forward is part of—about revitalizing American manufacturing and securing our supply chains, investing in research and development, as we used to, in a very healthy manner. But it's also about much more than that. It's about investing in infrastructure and infrastructure not for the 20th century, but the 21st century. It's not just roads and bridges. We're investing in water systems so Americans can have clean water infrastructure. We're investing in high-speed rail infrastructure. We're building charging stations to support America's electric future—electric vehicle future and investing in that infrastructure; and building out America's supply chains so we never again are at the mercy of another country or any other nation for the critical needs. That's what we would mean by investing in infrastructure. And we're investing in a more resilient grid, investing—I understand you discussed that a little bit earlier today. Investing as well in asbestos-free schools for our kids, that's investing in infrastructure. Building a support system to take care of our elderly parents and our kids with disabilities at home so that people can go to work, that's investing in infrastructure. Chips, like the one I have here—— [At this point, the President displayed a wafer as a visual example.] ——these chips, these wafers, or batteries, broadband, it's all infrastructure. This is infrastructure. So, look, we need to build the infrastructure of today, not repair the one of yesterday. And the plan I propose is going to create millions of jobs, rebuild America, protect our supply chains, and revitalize American manufacturing. And it's going to make American research and development a great engine again. We led the world in the middle of the 20th century. We led the world toward the end of the century. We're going to lead the world again. We're going to lead it again in the 21st century. We're—we have the best minds in the country; many of them are on the screen right now. And they know better than anyone that our competitiveness depends on where you invest and how you invest. For too long as a nation, we haven't been making the big, bold investments we need to outpace our global competitors. We've been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing. And put it bluntly, we have to step up our game. And I'm not ready to give up. I'm ready to work with all of you, with the Congress—both parties—to pass the American Jobs Plan and to make a once-in-a-generation investment in America's future. Again, we'll provide the innovation and spur breakthroughs. And we need the support—all your support—on the screen and others, in order to get this work done. And we need you, in turn, to support the American workers and American communities in every part of the country. This is a moment for American strength and American unity; for government, industries, communities to work together to make sure that we're ready to meet the global competition that lies ahead, not continuing to slide in terms of our investment. We're ranked, like, number 25th in the world now. That's not American. So I want to thank you all very much. And I appreciate all the time you've given us. Q. Mr. President——  Police-Involved Shooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on April 11  Q. Mr. President, could you speak to the issue in Minnesota, please, sir? Q. Mr. President, do you have a reaction to the shooting of Daunte Wright? Q. Wait. The President is going to speak. The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, just a second. Q. Mr. President, would you like to speak to the issue in Minnesota? The President. Wait, wait. Wait a—well, wait a second. What I'm going to do—I'm going to see you all again in a few minutes. I have just took—taken the time, even though I was a few minutes late, to listen to the press conference. I'm preparing a statement, and I'll be happy to talk with you at the next meeting. Okay? Thank you so much. Q. Thank you, sir."
"Apr 13, 2021",Remarks at a Congressional Tribute for United States Capitol Police Officer William F. Evans,"The President. Hello, everybody. Police-Involved Shooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota/Protests and Civil Unrest in Metropolitan Minneapolis  I told you a moment ago that I would comment briefly on what happened in Minnesota last night. We've spoken to the Governor and the mayor. I've spoken to the authorities there. And I haven't called Daunte Wright's family, but our prayers are with the family. It was a really tragic thing that happened. We're—and—but I think we've got to wait and see what the investigation shows—and the entire investigation. You've all watched, I assume—as I did—the film, which is fairly—the body cam—which is fairly graphic. The question is: Was it an accident? Was it intentional? That remains to be determined by a full-blown investigation. But, in the meantime, I want to make it clear again: There is absolutely no justification—none—for looting, no justification for violence. Peaceful protest, understandable. And the fact is that, you know, we do know that the anger, pain, and trauma that exists in the Black community in that environment is real, it's serious, and it's consequential. But it doesn't—it will not justify violence and/or looting. And so, the question is how we, in an orderly way, make clear that they get down to a full-blown investigation to determine what the facts are and what is likely to have happened. In the meantime, we're calling for peace and calm. And we should listen to Daunte's mom, who is calling for peace and calm. And that's all I have to say at this moment on that issue. So—— Protests and Civil Unrest in Metropolitan Minneapolis/Trial of Former Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020  Q. Mr. President, do you think there should be Federal resources to help keep the peace? Do you think you need to take any additional steps? The President. There are already Federal resources. And we have a significant—we've spent a significant amount of time, unrelating to this particular case, in dealing with what may be the aftermath of anything that happens with the trial that's underway. But there will not be lack of help and support from the Federal Government if the local authorities believe it's needed. I hope it's not. Q. Are you concerned things could be on a razor's edge, sir? The President. I'm not going to speculate now. I'm hopeful that there will be a verdict and an outcome that will be supported by the vast majority of the people in the region. And that's my expectation and hope. Thank you. Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation  Q. Mr. President, do you want to speak on infrastructure? The President. Thank you. Thank you. Q. Mr. President, do you want to speak on infrastructure at all, sir? The President. I think—that's why we're here. It's a bipartisan meeting here. We've got the Dean here. Don Young is here. We've got the Dean. [Laughter] So everything is going to be all right. But, all kidding aside, we're—we're—I'm prepared to negotiate as to how—the extent of the—my infrastructure project, as well as how we pay for it. But I—if we get in a serious conversation about how to do that. I think everyone acknowledges we need significant increase in infrastructure. It's going to get down to what we call infrastructure. Some people don't think that—I'm not suggesting anybody here has that view, but there's a lot of folks saying that the fact that we have millions of people not able to drink water because there's lead in the—there—it's coming through lead pipes—I think that's infrastructure. I think broadband is infrastructure. It's not just roads, bridges, highways, et cetera. So that's what we're going to talk about, and I'm confident everything is going to work out perfectly. [Laughter] Bipartisanship  Q. Mr. President, some Republicans—some Republicans say that they're concerned about being ""window dressing,"" Mr. President. The President. I'm not big on window dressing, if you've observed. Thank you very much."
"Apr 13, 2021",Remarks Prior to Meeting With Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and an Exchange With Reporters,"Madam Speaker; Majority Leader Schumer; Minority Leader McCarthy; my friend, Minority Leader McConnell; Members of Congress; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley; Attorney General Garland; Mayor Bowser; all the Capitol Hill Police and all that are here to pay tribute to this Capitol policeman who fell in the line of duty; Acting Chief Pittman, and the men and women of the Capitol Police force: I'm sorry: the second time in 2 months we have such a ceremony. And you know, Mom, I didn't know Billy, but I knew Billy. I grew up with Billys in Claymont and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Billy was always the kid that you know if you got in a fight and you're outnumbered three to one, he'd still jump in, knowing you'd both get beaten. He was the one who always kept his word. If he said he'd be there, he'd be there. He was the one who was just like the folks I grew up with, wasn't capable of saying no when you needed him. You know, just like you, Officer Kenny Shaver, who was injured in the attack with Billy. And never has there been more strain—and I've been here a long time; I've been here since 1972 as U.S. Senator—'73—has so much strain and responsibility been placed on the shoulders of the Capitol Police. And yet you hear it, you see it, you watch them, and you watch them do their duty with pure courage and not complain. You know, Sergeant Kyle King, I'm sorry you had to make the call—that telephone call that every family dreads when they have a son or daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister in uniform. Because every morning they pin that badge on, go to work, they expect to come home. In the back of your minds, ""We'll never get that call."" You knew Billy since grade school. I think it was in fourth grade. I've got to deal with all the guys that I grew up and knew in fourth grade. When one passes away, the other one has to give up because he has too much information about you, too much to leave behind. [Laughter] But you know, I'm sure all those memories from North Adams and Clarksburg never changed who Billy was. He was defined by his dignity, his decency, his loyalty, and his courage. And, Mom, that's because of you and his dad. That's how it happened, not by accident. Ms. Evans, you have—I have some idea of what you're feeling like. I buried two of my children. And people have come up to you and are going to come up to you for some time and say, ""I know how you feel."" They're going to say that to sis. They're going to say that to the kids. They're going to say that to his former wife. And after a while—you know everybody means well—you feel like saying, ""You have no idea."" But the truth is that a time is going to come, I promise you—not believable now—when a memory, a fragrance, a scene, a circumstance, the way his son tilts his head the way he did when he was that age—it's going to bring back the memory. And for the longest time, it's going to feel like, at that moment, that memory—it's going to feel like you got the phone call just that moment ago. And there are going to be people celebrating Billy's life. And as much as you appreciate it—all of you—it also is hard; you relive everything again. And you know, I got a phone call when I first got here and lost my family—part of my family—from a person I never knew, never met: the former Governor of New Jersey, who was literally 40—45 years my senior. And he told me he knew how I felt. And I didn't say anything. He said, ""I know what you're thinking."" He said, ""But I did know."" He said: ""I used to come home—I was the attorney general of New Jersey before I was Governor. And I'd come home for lunch because I lived just across the green from my office. And one day, a woman who helped out at our home came running across the green saying, 'She's gone. She's gone.'"" His wife had had an aneurysm. And he said, ""You know what I did?"" He said, ""I kept a—I got graph paper, and 4 months out, I would put the month on it and then a horizontal line. I'd put the date and the month. In the vertical line, I put the numbers 1 to 10. Ten would be the happiest day of my life, and one would be like the moment I got the phone call."" And he said: ""And every night before I'd go to bed, I'd graph it. I'd put on a dot on that day where I was."" And he said, ""Don't look at it for 3 or 4 months."" He said, ""And you'll look at it and you'll see."" He'd put it on a graph. ""The downs are just as far down, but they get further and further and further apart."" That's how you're all going to know that you're going to make it: by holding each other together, and most importantly, by holding Logan and Abigail as tightly as you can. Because as long as you have them, you've got Billy. As long as you have them. You know, my prayer for all of you is that a day will come when you have that memory, and I've said, ""Just smile before you bring a tear to your eyes."" It's—I promise you it's going to come. It just takes a while. It takes a while. But when it comes, you'll know, because he's still with you. He's still in your heart. Losing a son, daughter, brother, sister, mom, dad—it's like losing a piece of your soul. But it's buried deep, but it comes back. There's a great quote by R.G. Ingersoll. It was read when my son, who was the chief law enforcement officer in the State of Delaware—the attorney general—came back from Iraq after a year, and he died. And they read this poem from R.G. Ingersoll, who said, ""When will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns compromise with death, this is heroism."" Your son, your husband, your brother, your dad was a hero. And he's part of you. It's in your blood. My prayer for you is that moment when a smile comes before the tear, quicker than longer. Thank you."
"Apr 14, 2021",Remarks on United States Military Operations in Afghanistan,"The President. Well, look, it's an honor to be with all of you today, and II know it's been a pretty painful week, you know, with the losses we've had. You know, a good friend, Alcee Hastings, which I knew a long, long time. And to lose him is losing a piece of the—I don't know what—just losing a piece of something. And also, you know, with Daunte Wright in Minnesota—that God-awful shooting and resulting in his death—and in the midst of an ongoing trial over the killing of George Floyd. And Lord only knows what's happened based on what the verdict will or will not be there. And—but we're in the business, all of us meeting today, to deliver some real change. When we took office—I had a talk with Jim at length about this—every single aspect of—I signed the Executive order—every single aspect of our Government, including every agency, has, as a primary focus, dealing with equity. And not a joke. From the beginning, we talked at length about it, Jim. And not only is—but we also have an awful lot of things we have to deal with, not—when it comes to police, when it comes to advancing equality, economic opportunity. Cedric always says the thing that he—would drive him crazy is that everybody, when we want to talk about equity in the Black community, they talk about prisons. Well, that's part of it, man, but that's not—it's about income. It's about being able to earn a living. It's about being able to be in a position where you have economic opportunity. And so I look forward to discussing all these priorities, the CBC priorities and the goals you have for the community, but quite frankly, for—the goals you have for the community are good for every community—for every community. And I'd like to take some—spend some time in the American Jobs Act, which I think some of you actually helped me put that together with the ideas you gave me early on. And I think we can make significant, significant changes. We—in the last little bit of legislation you helped me pass, we've reduced child poverty, and we reduced poverty in Black communities significantly, just by that act alone. One of my objectives there is—overall objectives is to make those changes permanent. You've been leading that one for a long time, pal. And so—anyway, we've got a lot to talk about. And I'm looking forward to having this meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. And they—I think we can get a lot done. So thank you all for joining us. Q. Mr. President—— Q. Mr. President, a question about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. [At this point, several reporters asked questions at once.] Law Enforcement's Interactions With the African American Community  Q. Mr. President, what is the actual hope that people should have that there'll be a change in the way that African Americans interact with police in this country during the Biden era? What can you deliver on, sir? The President. A lot. And I'll tell you later. Let's go. Coronavirus Vaccine Availability  Q. Any response to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? The President. My message to the American people on the vaccine is—I told you all: I made sure we have 600 million doses of the MR—not of either Johnson and Johnson and/or AstraZeneca. So there's enough vaccine that is basically a hundred-percent unquestionable for every single, solitary American. Thank you."
"Apr 14, 2021","Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters After Paying Respects at Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia","Good afternoon. I'm speaking to you today from the Roosevelt—the Treaty Room in the White House. The same spot where, on October of 2001, President George W. Bush informed our Nation that the United States military had begun strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. It was just weeks—just weeks—after the terrorist attack on our Nation that killed 2,977 innocent souls; that turned Lower Manhattan into a disaster area, destroyed parts of the Pentagon, and made hallowed ground of a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and sparked an American promise that we would ""never forget."" We went to Afghanistan in 2001 to root out Al Qaida, to prevent future terrorist attacks against the United States planned from Afghanistan. Our objective was clear. The cause was just. Our NATO allies and partners rallied beside us. And I supported that military action, along with overwhelming majority of the Members of Congress. More than 7 years later, in 2008, weeks before we swore the oath of office—President Obama and I were about to swear—President Obama asked me to travel to Afghanistan and report back on the state of the war in Afghanistan. I flew to Afghanistan, to the Kunar Valley, a rugged, mountainous region on the border with Pakistan. What I saw on that trip reinforced my conviction that only the Afghans have the right and responsibility to lead their country and that more and endless American military force could not create or sustain a durable Afghan Government. I believed that our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: to ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again. We did that. We accomplished that objective. I said, among—with others, we'd follow Usama bin Laden to the gates of hell if need be. That's exactly what we did, and we got him. It took us close to 10 years to put President Obama's commitment to—into form. And that's exactly what happened; Usama bin Laden was gone. That was 10 years ago. Think about that. We delivered justice to bin Laden a decade ago, and we've stayed in Afghanistan for a decade since. Since then, our reasons for remaining in Afghanistan are becoming increasingly unclear, even as the terrorist threat that we went to fight evolved. Over the past 20 years, the threat has become more dispersed, metastasizing around the globe: al-Shabaab in Somalia; Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Nusra in Syria; ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. With the terror threat now in many places, keeping thousands of troops grounded and concentrated in just one country at a cost of billions each year makes little sense to me and to our leaders. We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result. I'm now the fourth United States President to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth. After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, as well as with Mr. Ghani and many others around the world, I have concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. It's time for American troops to come home. When I came to office, I inherited a diplomatic agreement, duly negotiated between the Government of the United States and the Taliban, that all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just 3 months after my Inauguration. That's what we inherited, that commitment. It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself, but it was an agreement made by the United States Government, and that means something. So, in keeping with that agreement and with our national interests, the United States will begin our final withdrawal—begin it—on May 1 of this year. We will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit. We'll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely. And we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners, who now have more forces in Afghanistan than we do. And the Taliban should know that if they attack us as we draw down, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal. Our allies and partners have stood beside us shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and we're deeply grateful for the contributions they have made to our shared mission and for the sacrifices they have borne. The plan has long been ""in together, out together."" U.S. troops, as well as forces deployed by our NATO allies and operational partners, will be out of Afghanistan before we mark the 20th anniversary of that heinous attack on September 11. But we'll not take our eye off the terrorist threat. We'll reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent reemergence of terrorists—of the threat to our homeland from over the horizon. We'll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil. The Afghan Government has made that commitment to us as well. And we'll focus our full attention on the threat we face today. At my direction, my team is refining our national strategy to monitor and disrupt significant terrorist threats not only in Afghanistan, but anywhere they may arise—and they're in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. I spoke yesterday with President Bush to inform him of my decision. While he and I have had many disagreements over policies throughout the years, we're absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, courage, and integrity of the women and men of the United States Armed Forces who served. I'm immensely grateful for the bravery and backbone that they have shown through nearly two decades of combat deployments. We as a Nation are forever indebted to them and to their families. You all know that less than 1 percent of Americans serve in our Armed Forces. The remaining 99 percent of them—we owe them. We owe them. They have never backed down from a single mission that we've asked of them. I've witnessed their bravery firsthand during my visits to Afghanistan. They've never wavered in their resolve. They've paid a tremendous price on our behalf. And they have the thanks of a grateful nation. While we will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue. We'll continue to support the Government of Afghanistan. We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan National Defenses and Security Forces. And along with our partners, we have trained and equipped a standing force of over 300,000 Afghan personnel today and hundreds of thousands over the past two decades. And they'll continue to fight valiantly, on behalf of the Afghans, at great cost. They'll support peace talks, as we will support peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations. And we'll continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls by maintaining significant humanitarian and development assistance. And we'll ask other countries—other countries in the region—to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey. They all have a significant stake in the stable future for Afghanistan. And, over the next few months, we will also determine what a continued U.S. diplomatic presence in Afghanistan will look like, including how we'll ensure the security of our diplomats. Now, look, I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust U.S. military presence to stand as leverage. We gave that argument a decade. It's never proved effective, not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan and not when we were down to a few thousand. Our diplomacy does not hinge on having boots in harm's way, U.S. boots on the ground. We have to change that thinking. American troops shouldn't be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries. You know, that's nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. I also know there are many who will argue that we should stay fighting in Afghanistan because withdrawal would damage America's credibility and weaken America's influence in the world. I believe the exact opposite is true. We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us. We have to track and disrupt terrorist networks and operations that spread far beyond Afghanistan since 9/11. We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we're facing from an increasingly assertive China. We have to strengthen our alliances and work with like-minded partners to ensure that the rules of international norms that govern cyber threats and emerging technologies that will shape our future are grounded in our democratic values, not those of the autocrats. We have to defeat this pandemic and strengthen the global health system to prepare for the next one, because there will be another pandemic. You know, we'll be much more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long term if we fight the battles for the next 20 years, not the last 20. And finally, the main argument for staying longer is what each of my three predecessors have grappled with: No one wants to say that we should be in Afghanistan forever, but they insist now is not the right moment to leave. In 2014, NATO issued a declaration affirming that Afghan Security Forces would, from that point on, have full responsibility for their country's security by the end of that year. That was 7 years ago. So when will it be the right moment to leave? One more year, 2 more years, 10 more years? Ten, twenty, thirty billion dollars more above the trillion we've already spent? ""Not now""—that's how we got here. And, in this moment, there's a significant downside risk to staying beyond May 1 without a clear timetable for departure. If we instead pursue the approach where America—U.S. exit is tied to conditions on the ground, we have to have clear answers to the following questions: Just what conditions require to—be required to allow us to depart? By what means and how long would it take to achieve them, if they could be achieved at all? And at what additional cost in lives and treasure? I'm not hearing any good answers to these questions. And if you can't answer them, in my view, we should not stay. The fact is that later today I'm going to visit Arlington National Cemetery, Section 60, and that sacred memorial to American sacrifice. Section 60 is where our recent war dead are buried, including many of the women and men who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. There's no comforting distance in history in Section 60. The grief is raw. It's a visceral reminder of the living cost of war. For the past 12 years, ever since I became Vice President, I've carried with me a card that reminds me of the exact number of American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. That exact number, not an approximation or rounded-off number—because every one of those dead are sacred human beings who left behind entire families. An exact accounting of every single solitary one needs to be had. As of the day—today, there are two-hundred-and-forty—2,488 [2,448]* U.S. troops and personnel who have died in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Freedom's Sentinel—our Afghanistan conflicts; 20,722 have been wounded. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a war zone. And throughout this process, my north star has been remembering what it was like when my late son Beau was deployed to Iraq—how proud he was to serve his country; how insistent he was to deploy with his unit; and the impact it had on him and all of us at home. We already have servicemembers doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war. We have servicemembers who were not yet born when our Nation was attacked on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multigenerational undertaking. We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Laden is dead, and Al Qaida is degraded in Iraq—in Afghanistan. And it's time to end the forever war. Thank you all for listening. May God protect our troops. May God bless all those families who lost someone in this endeavor."
"Apr 15, 2021",Remarks Prior to Meeting With the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Executive Committee and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hard to believe, isn't it? Bravery of U.S. Servicemembers  Q. Mr. President, what does this moment mean to you? The President. It means that I—I'm always amazed at generation after generation, the women and men who are prepared to give their lives for their country. But they don't give it for their country, per se; they give it for their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, their uncles, their aunts. And I—it means that I have trouble these days ever showing up at a veterans cemetery and not thinking of my son Beau, who proudly insisted on putting on that uniform and going with his unit to Iraq and giving up his spot as attorney general of the State of Delaware because he thought it was the right thing to do. And look at them all. Counterterrorism Efforts/U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan  Q. Was it a hard decision to make? The President. I'm sorry? Q. Was it a hard decision to make, sir? The President. No, it wasn't. To me, it was absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. We went for two reasons: to get rid of bin Laden and to end the safe haven. From the very beginning, you may recall, I never thought we were there to somehow unify Iraq—I mean, excuse me, Afghanistan. It's never been done. It's never been done. Thank you all for being out here in the rain. It means a lot. Thank you."
"Apr 15, 2021",Remarks on Russia-United States Relations and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Hey, everybody. National Economy  Before we get started, I want to make it clear that we have some good news today, and that is that retail sales this last month have surged by 9.8 percent as American families received that $1,400 check because of the people in this room are getting it done for me. And auto sales are up 15 percent. Things are moving. And these checks are providing a heck of a lot of needed relief for families and, in turn, needed support for our economic recovery. And today's news comes on top of the recent news that we created 900,000 jobs in this—in the month of March. The first 2 months of our administration, we've created more jobs than the first 2 months of any administration in American history. And again—I'm not being solicitous—it's because of you all. I really mean it. The way you fought like the devil to get—you really did—to get that package passed. I mean, it really did. And I want to thank the Members for supporting the American Rescue Plan. And we still have a long way to go. We're 8 million jobs down from what it was more than—before the pandemic began, but America is coming back. Meeting With the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Executive Committee  And with regard to—I want to express my gratitude to the group we have here today from the House representing this Caucus, which represents vital communities and very diverse communities within the Asian American, Hawaiian—excuse me—and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders community. And what I think what most people don't realize is just how diverse it is; how broad it is; how many different dialects, languages, and the like are spoken, which is part of what we have to deal with and solve. And we need to stand with the AAPI community and the whole-of-Government response with what we have to get done. When I came into office, the first bill I signed related to racial equity throughout the Government. That's still the plan. That's my objective. And Kamala and I are heartened by the Senate's overwhelming bipartisan effort yesterday, Senator, for the passage of the Hate Crimes Act. That's a big deal. I mean, it was really close. Only—what?—98 votes. [Laughter] Senator Mazie K. Hirono. Long way to go yet. The President. But I'll tell you what—— Sen. Hirono. But it was really nice. [Laughter] The President. Well, it was now. I thought it was going to pass, but, my Lord, you—I tell you. I—and we took a vote here in the administration: You're going to handle the jobs bill—[laughter]—because anybody who can get 98 votes for anything—— Sen. Hirono. Why, sure. [Laughter] The President. So, anyway, I'm looking forward to our discussion with the Caucus. And I just want to thank you all for being here. And thank you for coming in, press. U.S.-Russia Relations  Q. Mr. President, do you see a path forward to a stable relationship with Russia? The President. Folks, I'm going to be speaking to Russia, and my conversation with President Putin shortly after this meeting is over—you'll be notified of that, and I'll be happy to talk to you then. Okay?"
"Apr 16, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan,"The President. Hello, folks. Thanks for coming over. Good afternoon, everyone. Earlier this week, I spoke with President Putin of Russia about the nature of our relationship, the relationship between our two countries. And I was candid and respectful; the conversation was candid and respectful. Two great powers with significant responsibility for global stability. And President Putin and I have had a significant responsibility to steward that relationship. I take that responsibility very seriously, as I'm sure he does. Russia and Americans are both proud and patriotic people. And I believe the Russian people, like the American people, are invested in peaceful and a secure future of our world. During the campaign for my—for the Presidency, I was unequivocal that if I was elected President, I would respond to any attempt to influence our elections—the last election and—because elections are sacred. They're sovereign undertakings, and they're an expression of the will of the American people, and we cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity. And I told him: If it turned out that the invest—as I thought—that there was engagement in our elections, that I would—that I'd respond. Later, during the transition, as we learned more about the SolarWinds cyber intrusion, I made clear that I would respond once we determined who had, in fact, conducted a hack on the scope and scale that occurred. When President Putin called me in January, after I was sworn in, to congratulate me, I told him that my administration—we were looking very carefully, now that we had access to all the data, and at the issues that—to assess Russia's role and then determine what response we would make. When we spoke again this week, I told him that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election, and SolarWinds was totally out of the—inappropriate. Today I've approved several steps, including expulsion of several Russian officials, as a consequence of their actions. I've also signed an Executive order authorizing new measures, including sanctions to address specific harmful actions that Russia has taken against U.S. interests. I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so, to be—I chose to be proportionate. The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship. If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I'm prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility, as President of the United States, to do so. But throughout our long history of competition, our two countries have been able to find ways to manage tensions and to keep them from escalating out of control. There are also areas where Russia and the United States can and should work together. For example, in the earliest days of my administration, we were able to move quickly to extend, for 5 years, the New START Treaty, and maintain that key element of nuclear stability between our nations. That was in the interest of the United States, of Russia, and quite frankly, of the world, and we got it done. When I spoke to President Putin, I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us, personally and directly, was to be essential in moving forward to a more effective relationship. And he agreed on that point. To that end, I proposed that we meet in person this summer in Europe, for a summit to address a range of issues facing both of our countries. Our teams are discussing that possibility right now. And out of that summit—were it to occur, and I believe it will—the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue to pursue cooperation in arms control and security. We can address critical global challenges that require Russia and the United States to work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally, and meeting the existential crisis of climate change. I also made clear to President Clutin that the United—Putin—that the United States is unwavering in our support of our allies and partners in Europe. In that vein, I expressed concern about Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's border and occupied—and in occupied Crimea. I affirmed U.S. support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. And I strongly urged him to refrain from any military action. Now is the time to de-escalate. The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process. The U.S. is prepared to continue constructively to move forward that process. My bottom line is this: Where it is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia, we should, and we will. Where Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States, we will respond. And we'll always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people, and our allies. Thank you very much for your time. President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia  Q. Mr. President, did President Putin give you any indication in that call that he is willing to change his behavior? The President. We indicated we would talk about it. I laid out, as I said, very simply—I told—I said during the campaign; I said when he called to congratulate me on being elected; I said, subsequent to that, this last conversation, that if it turned out that he was engaged in the activities that he'd been accused of in cybersecurity and SolarWinds and interfering in our elections that I would respond in kind. I urged him to respond appropriately, not to exceed it, because we can move as well. My hope and expectation is, we'll be able to work out a modus vivendi. And—but it's important that we have direct talks and that we continue to be in contact with one another. Thank you. Q. Why not—on Nord Stream—— Q. Mr. President, do you expect to have a summit? The President. Pardon me? Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline  Q. Why not—on Nord Stream, why didn't you keep going with the sanction—sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Mr. President? The President. Nord Stream 2 is a complicated issue affecting our allies in Europe. I've been opposed to Nord Stream 2 for a long time, from the beginning, when I was even—when I was out of office and even before office, when we—before I left office as Vice President. But that still is an issue that is in play. Thank you very much."
"Apr 19, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Members of Congress on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters,"President Biden. Well, I'm honored to have Prime Minister Suga here. Yoshi and I have had some private time together, both lunch and tea, and it's great to have him with us. As you know, this was the first foreign leader to visit me in my Presidency. And I'm really pleased to welcome such a close ally and good partner. The United States and Japan have a big agenda ahead of us. And we are two important democracies in the Indo-Pacific region, and our cooperation is vital, in my view—and I think in both our views—to meeting the challenges facing our nation and ensuring the future of the region to remain free and open and prosperous. So I'm looking forward to speaking with the Prime Minister. And our teams are tackling a shared agenda. We are ready to get to work. So welcome, Mr. Prime Minister. As we say in the body I used to work in, the United States Senate, ""I yield the floor"" to the Prime Minister. It's all yours, Yoshi. Prime Minister Suga. Thank you very much. Thank for you for accepting me as the first foreign leader under your Presidency. My deepest gratitude to you. And yesterday there was a shooting in Indianapolis, so I heard, and causing much casualty. I would like to express my condolences to the victims and my sympathies to the families. Innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence. Freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are the universal values that link our alliance that is prevalent in the Indo-Pacific, and this is the very foundation of prosperity and stability of the region and the globe. And the importance of such values has heightened to unprecedented level. And upon my visit to the United States, I wish to reaffirm the new and tight bond between us. And in order to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific, there are many common challenges as well as emerging global issues, including COVID-19 and climate change. I wish to spend time with you to again confirm the close ties between our two countries. And thank you again for accepting us. President Biden. Thank you being here. Thank you for your sentiments."
"Apr 20, 2021",Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Hispanic Caucus Leadership and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Thanks for coming in, guys. I want to thank my colleagues—they're still my colleagues; I'm more of a Member of Congress than I've been here. And—but I'm glad you all came down. We're going to talk about our infrastructure package. And as I indicated earlier, I am prepared to compromise, prepared to see what we can do and what we can get together on. It's a big package, but there's a lot of needs. And so we're going to be talking about, number one, what should be included in the package—obviously, I put a lot in the package; I think it all should be included—and how to pay for it. And there are two issues. I've noticed everybody is for infrastructure. [Laughter] The question is: Who's going to pay for it? And that's what we're going to try to work out today, at least in this bipartisan group of Members of the House and Senate. And, a little secret here, we're going to—in full disclosure, I asked Senators and Congressmen who had either been Governors or mayors because they know what it's like to make things work, to make sure that you get things done and deal with infrastructure and the needs of your community. So that's why we're here. We—hopefully, we'll be able to reach some kind of consensus, at least in broad terms. So thank you all for coming in. And we'll be talking to you later. Infrastructure  Q. Mr. President, what do you think about the idea of paying for it with user fees? The President. That's what we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about all that right now. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Apr 20, 2021","Remarks on the Verdict in the Trial of Former Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the 2020 Death of George Floyd","The President. Thanks for taking the time to come in. We're having a very important meeting. There's a lot on our agenda from the CHC. We've got a lot to talk about. Representatives from the House and the Senate—and I wanted to express my gratitude to the Caucus for being willing to come down. We've got a whole range of issues to discuss. And you know, I want to make sure that—from the American Rescue Plan, to COVID—I told the doc that I—if I hadn't had my shot already, I'd ask him to give me one because he's been taking care of business. But the America—in our view, and I mean it sincerely—cannot succeed if it's—unless Hispanic families succeed. You know, we talk about—I know I'm tired of hearing me say it for a year and a half—we talk about the idea that—with the last administration's failure to invest or being even—be anywhere remotely positive. But I—the point I keep making, to remind people—and people understand it, and the recent polling nationwide shows they understand it—is that 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school right now is a Latino or Hispanic. The idea that we're not going to invest in what will be roughly 25 percent of the population by the time these kids are in our positions, it's just absolutely—it makes no sense. And that's what we're all about. We're going to talk about everything today, my guess is, from immigration to the—my Jobs Plan and what—how it worked for you and how it didn't, what you think we should be doing. We're also creating a whole lot ofjob opportunities in neighborhoods, because for most of the—where I come from and all of you come from—is that it gets down to neighborhoods—it gets down to neighborhoods—whether that grocery store is open, whether that local bank is there, whether the—whether or not you have a barber shop, a beauty shop. It all matters. It matters about people and their communities and how they belong. So we're going to spend some time pushing forward—I'm going to spend some time trying to sell you all on what I think you're sold on with the jobs bill and the aspects of the jobs bill. And I want to talk a little strategy with you all as well, if that's okay. If that's all right with you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Robert Menendez. Whatever you say, Mr. President. The President. All right. The chairman is now chairman of the committee that I enjoyed more than anything I did in my whole career; he's chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. So the Vice President and I are looking forward to this meeting, and we're going to try to get a lot done. And I think it's always great when a meeting starts off in a meeting with a bunch of friends. [Laughter] So thank you all for being here. That's what we're going to be talking about today. Thank you. Trial of Former Police Officer Derek Chauvin in the Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020  Q. President Biden, you spoke to George Floyd's family; what was your message? The President. I know, George—I'm just going to answer that one question because George is—I've come to know George's family not just in passing—I've spent time with them. I spent time with his little daughter Gianna—you should see this beautiful child; and his brother—both brothers, as a matter of fact. And so I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they're feeling. And so I waited until the jury was sequestered, and—I called. And as—I wasn't going to say anything about it, but Philonise said today on television, and he accurately said—it was a private conversation—because Joe understands what it's like to go through loss. And they're a good family. And they're calling for peace and tranquility no matter what that verdict is. I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is—I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now and not hearing me say that. But—so we just talked a little. I wanted to know how they were doing, just personally. And we talked about personal things. Thank you very much for coming in."
